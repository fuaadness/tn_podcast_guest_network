His face is scrunched up with his eyes squeezed tight and his tongue is sticking out of its mouth. It's the face you make when you taste something disgusting. He's the pictorial embodiment of the sentiment of yuck. Aptly enough: he was designed to be the symbol for hazardous substances, aimed at deterring children from ingesting them. The idea what that if you saw a Mr. Yuk sticker on something around the house, it meant that that something was poison.Friend of the show, Gillian Jacobs, is a BIG FAN of Mr Yuk, who turns out to be a hometown hero of her beloved Pittsburgh, and talked Roman through the origins of the mean, green face that was meant to save children from their worst impulses.Plus, we revisit another story about warning symbols from our archive: the quest to find a symbol that would warn future humans of dangerous radiation 10,000 years in the future.Mr. Yuk Subscribe to SiriusXM Podcasts+ to listen to new episodes of 99% Invisible ad-free and a whole week early. Start a free trial now on Apple Podcasts or by visiting siriusxm.com/podcastsplus.  Hosted by Simplecast, an AdsWizz company.

She also starred in period dramas, including an acclaimed film adaptation of Edith Wharton’s novel The House Of Mirth and, on television, in Bleak House, Great Expectations and War and Peace. Her theatre credits include A Doll’s House, A Streetcar Named Desire and All About Eve, all of which saw her nominated for Olivier Awards. Gillian Anderson has won Golden Globe and Emmy Awards for the X Files, and also for The Crown in which she played Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. More recently, she found a new generation of fans for role as a sex therapist in the series Sex Education. Her latest film is The Salt Path, adapted from the bestselling memoir by Raynor Wynn.Gillian Anderson tells John Wilson how, after being born in Chicago, she moved with her parents to Crouch End, London, when she was five, and then to Michigan at the age of 11. After what she describes as ‘rebellious' teenage years, she studied at Chicago’s DePaul University with drama teacher Ric Murphy, whom she cites as a major influence on her early acting ambitions. After a series of minor stage roles in New York, she auditioned for The X Files and the role of Agent Scully changed her life. She also chooses the actor Meryl Streep as a major inspiration after seeing her with Robert Redford in the 1985 romantic drama film Out Of Africa. Gillian also reveals how the work of the Serbian-born conceptual performance artist Marina Abramović has also been an influential cultural figure for her.Producer: Edwina Pitman",https://open.spotify.com/episode/42JNdc5xCknYUWeYrPE170,2025-06-05,6a4j1G2wNCnljlB6zsyGQc,This Cultural Life,BBC Radio 4,1761057405.1585512

Now, in her off-screen life, Anderson has taken on a similar role: gathering the sexual fantasies of women from around the world.

In today's episode, Anderson speaks with NPR's Mary Louise Kelly about the 1970s book that inspired the project, how the changing media landscape has influenced how women think about sex and the difficulty of asking for what we really want.To listen to Book of the Day sponsor-free and support NPR's book coverage, sign up for Book of the Day+ at plus.npr.org/bookofthedayLearn more about sponsor message choices: podcastchoices.com/adchoicesNPR Privacy Policy",https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RpcUXpABBuS0bfHC0dxuc,2024-09-25,3dpIUpUortdZ91gi08QO8Z,NPR's Book of the Day,NPR,1761057406.4223065

We explore Rose’s critique of early twentieth-century sociology, which she argues was completely hampered by the limitations of its neo-Kantian framework. Looking to break out of this transcendental circle, Rose turns to Hegel and defends a highly original and sophisticated reading of his speculative political thinking, in order to develop a sociological analysis adequate for grasping and transforming our modern capitalist world. We also talk about why Hegel hated the starry skies above and thought slimes and rashes were way cooler.leftofphilosophy.com | @leftofphilFollow James on twitter: @gruidae_james and check out his substack: https://jamescrane.substack.com/References:Gillian Rose, Hegel Contra Sociology (New York: Verso, 2009)Music: Vintage Memories by Schematist | schematist.bandcamp.com",https://open.spotify.com/episode/6KHYhmF5v2eYg0g1BpPRFL,2022-09-19,4CfuFJBCH41fHiicB7SgX5,What's Left of Philosophy,"Lillian Cicerchia, Owen Glyn-Williams, Gil Morejón, and William Paris",1761057406.4300613

And it singled out co-stars Joel McHale and Gillian Jacobs for the developments in their characters. So how lucky am I to welcome Community beauty Gillian to Mr. Media today? Pretty damn lucky. < Order 'Community: The Complete Third Season' starring Gillian Jacobs, available from Amazon.com by clicking on the DVD cover above! GILLIAN JACOBS podcast excerpt: ""You start with this kind sensible person in the pilot. As the season goes on, you find her shortcomings, her flaws, her quirks. She gets told she is humorless. She's no longer the moral authority on the show. Donald's character, Troy, has this line, 'I want to believe you, Britta, but you're not quite right, are you?'"" Gillian’s character, “Britta,” has grown as “Community” itself blossomed this season. When the show debuted, she seemed destined to be a one-noter whose sole purpose seemed to be swatting down blatant advances by McHale’s womanizing character Jeff. But as the weeks went on, the writers found better, smarter ways of putting her to work, expanding Britta into as fully formed a person as everyone around her-including the more evolved Jeff. Regular listeners know I’m a fan of “Community,” which is why Gillian is the fifth star of the show invited to join me on Mr. Media.

Malala Yousafzai,"""Malala Yousafzai""",3P1IytC06Pw9b9QZDBq3p2,MALALA: The Story The World Hasn’t Heard Until Now,"Today, Jay sits down with Malala Yousafzai to uncover the woman behind the global symbol of courage and education. From the very start, Jay sets the tone with an intention rooted in empathy, to help people not just know Malala, but understand her. Together, they revisit her extraordinary journey, from growing up in Pakistan’s Swat Valley under Taliban rule to surviving an assassination attempt at fifteen. Malala shares what it was like to wake up in a hospital far from home, and how she slowly began to realize that the world had already decided who she was before she could decide for herself. As the conversation unfolds, Malala opens up about the emotional aftermath of her survival, the years spent trying to live up to the image of bravery the world created for her while quietly struggling with fear, trauma, and loneliness. She reflects on how therapy helped her begin to process the pain she had long suppressed, and how rediscovering humor, friendship, and love became essential parts of her healing. Malala also talks about her marriage, her insecurities after the attack, and the importance of learning to love herself before fully believing that someone else could. Her honesty reveals a side rarely seen, that even those who inspire millions still wrestle with doubt and self-acceptance. Malala and Jay explore what courage truly means, not as a public act of heroism, but as a quiet, daily choice to keep going. She reflects on her mission to ensure education for every girl, the ongoing fight for women’s rights in Afghanistan, and how real change begins with local voices and global solidarity. Through her words, Malala reminds us that strength and softness can coexist, that healing is never linear, and that every person has the power to turn pain into purpose. In this interview, you'll learn: How to Stay Brave When You’re Afraid How to Heal From Trauma With Time and Therapy How to Find Yourself Beyond What the World Expects How to Rebuild Confidence After Losing It How to Create Change Through Education How to Love Yourself After Feeling Unworthy How to Redefine Courage in Everyday Life How to Keep Hope Alive in Dark Times How to Be the Voice for Those Who Can’t Speak No matter what you’ve been through, your story isn’t over, it’s still being written every single day. Healing doesn’t happen all at once, and courage isn’t about never breaking down; it’s about finding the strength to rise again, even when you feel unsure.

Malala Yousafzai,"""Malala Yousafzai""",3qDS2a2oKdzghvyl7CRoL2,Malala Yousafzai on How Small Actions Can Drive Meaningful Change,"The women’s rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner spoke with BoF’s Imran Amed about education, growing up as an activist and the evolution of her own activism at BoF VOICES 2022.Background:Malala Yousafzai, the activist and founder of the Malala Fund, has always fought stereotypes and labels. She says she no longer defines herself by the moment, at age 12, when she was shot in the head by a Taliban gunman while riding the bus to school. Already an activist for girls’ education before the assassination attempt, that moment on the bus vaulted Yousafzai onto the global stage, where for a decade she has remained one of the most prominent and effective voices for gender equality. Yousafzai says she welcomes the label of global activist in the fight for equality, as opposed to “the girl who was shot by the Taliban,” she said in a conversation with BoF’s founder and editor-in-chief Imran Amed at BoF VOICES 2022. “Here I am today fighting for the rights of all the girls around the world,” says Yousafzai. “[So that] the 130 million girls out of school today can have access to safe, quality, free education.” Finding this inner resilience has led her to global fame as she overcame restrictions not just on her own education but also on how she dressed. Referencing the protests seen across Iran and the Iranian diaspora, Yousafzai spoke about the need for freedom in dressing to liberate women to feel safe both in dictatorial states and in battling Western norms. This week on The BoF Podcast, Yousafzai speaks about the development of her personal activism and how education is at the heart of resistance. Key Insights:Activism is not just about thought leaders with big personalities, or huge crowds of protestors. Yousafzai also believes in the power of small actions to make change. “Sometimes when we think of activism in our mind we think of great speeches, we see a huge crowd of people and there stands an inspiring leader… but it is small actions that [defines] activism overall,” says Yousafzai. Education is a crucial resource to promote equality and secure opportunity for women. “[Education] is a key instrument in changing a lot of issues we were talking about, including inequality, climate change, poverty,” says Yousafzai. “Education is at the centre of all of this. To me what matters most is equality for everyone.”The sensitive matter of whether or not women wear a hijab should be a choice of faith not an external mandate, says Yousafzai. “It’s not just telling women that they should dress a certain way, but it’s actually limiting them from opportunities,” says Yousafzai. “It’s limiting them from having access to spaces again. Like just leave us alone. Let us wear what we want.”Additional Resources:BoF VOICES 2022: Live Your Best Life: In the final session of BoF’s annual gathering, speakers from model Dennis Okwera and Coty chief Sue Y.

Malala Yousafzai,"""Malala Yousafzai""",37UXYglBIgk2jzfRtnFFjm,Malala Yousafzai,"Malala Yousafzai, la voz valiente que lucha por la educación ¡Hola, exploradores de la imaginación!! Bienvenidos a otro episodio de ""Cuentos Brillantes para Niños Felices"". Hoy, nos embarcamos en un viaje increíble para conocer la inspiradora historia de Malala Yousafzai, una joven valiente que nos enseña el poder de la educación, el valor y la perseverancia. En el hermoso valle de Swat, en Pakistán, nació una niña llamada Malala en 1997. Desde muy pequeña, Malala amaba aprender y siempre tenía una sonrisa en su rostro cuando iba a la escuela. Su padre, que dirigía una escuela, la alentó a seguir su pasión por el conocimiento y a soñar en grande. A medida que crecía, Malala se daba cuenta de que no todas las niñas tenían la misma oportunidad de ir a la escuela. En su comunidad, muchas niñas se quedaban en casa y no podían aprender a leer ni escribir. Esto entristecía a Malala, ya que sabía lo importante que era la educación para cambiar sus vidas y las de sus familias. A los 11 años, Malala decidió alzar su voz y empezó a escribir un blog bajo un seudónimo para la BBC, donde describía las dificultades que enfrentaban las niñas para recibir educación en su región. Su valentía y sus palabras inspiraron a muchas personas, pero también atrajeron la atención de quienes no querían que las niñas fueran a la escuela. En 2012, cuando Malala tenía solo 15 años, un grupo de hombres malos atacó su autobús escolar. Malala fue gravemente herida, pero su espíritu indomable no se quebrantó. Fue llevada a un hospital en Inglaterra, donde recibió tratamiento y, gracias a su fortaleza y al apoyo de su familia y personas de todo el mundo, se recuperó milagrosamente. En lugar de quedarse en silencio, Malala se levantó con más fuerza y determinación que nunca. Sabía que debía seguir luchando por el derecho de todas las niñas a recibir educación. En 2013, pronunció un poderoso discurso en la Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas, donde dijo: ""Un niño, un maestro, un libro y una pluma pueden cambiar el mundo"". Malala continuó su misión y, junto con su padre, fundó el Fondo Malala, una organización dedicada a apoyar la educación de las niñas en todo el mundo. Su valentía y su compromiso con la causa de la educación han inspirado a millones de personas y han llevado esperanza a muchos lugares donde antes no la había. En 2014, Malala se convirtió en la persona más joven en recibir el Premio Nobel de la Paz, un reconocimiento a su valentía y a su incansable lucha por el derecho a la educación. A pesar de todos los desafíos y peligros que enfrentó, Malala nunca dejó de creer en el poder de la educación para transformar vidas y sociedades. La historia de Malala Yousafzai nos enseña que la valentía, la perseverancia y la fe en uno mismo pueden superar cualquier obstáculo. Nos recuerda que cada uno de nosotros tiene la capacidad de hacer una diferencia en el mundo, sin importar nuestra edad o nuestras circunstancias. Cierren sus ojos, pequeños héroes y soñadores, e imaginen a Malala levantándose valientemente para defender su derecho a aprender. ¿Qué les inspira su historia? ¿Qué sueños tienen ustedes que pueden cambiar el mundo? Recuerden que, al igual que Malala, ustedes también pueden alzar su voz, seguir sus pasiones y luchar por un mundo mejor. No tengan miedo de ser valientes y de creer en el poder de la educación y la justicia. Gracias por acompañarnos en este emocionante viaje a través de la vida de Malala Yousafzai. ¡Hasta la próxima, pequeños soñadores! ¡Sigan aprendiendo, sigan soñando y nunca dejen de creer en ustedes mismos!

In 2002, after the young men spent years of their lives behind bars, their sentences were overturned. Now known as the Exonerated Five, their story has been documented in the award-winning film The Central Park Five by Ken Burns, Sarah Burns, and David McMahon and in Ava DuVernay’s acclaimed series When They See Us. Yusef is now a poet, activist, and inspirational speaker. He is the recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award from President Barack Obama, among other honors. Ibi Zoboi is a novelist and editor, born in Haiti, and raised in Brooklyn, she found a love of writing, and poetry and eventually pursued an MFA from Vermont College of Fine Arts, before launching a career in journalism and then fiction. Her novel American Street was a National Book Award finalist and a New York Times Notable Book. She is also the author of Pride and My Life as an Ice Cream Sandwich, a New York Times bestseller, and it the editor of the anthology Black Enough. The two met briefly some 21 years ago, for a walk and talk that would eventually bring them back together to collaborate on a YA novel called Punching the Air (https://amzn.to/2PkcRND) that integrates Yusef’s story, poetry and illustrations with Ibi’s powerful storytelling to create a novel in verse that speak powerfully to issues of equity, dignity, art as a form of therapeutic depression and restoration. We drop into so many points along each of their journeys, how they first met and the context for that meeting that would change both their lives and nearly 20 years later, they came back together to co-create this rich novel in verse.You can find Ibi Zoboi at:Website : http://www.ibizoboi.net/Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/ibizoboi/You can find Dr. Yusef Salaam at:Website : http://www.yusefspeaks.com/Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/dr.yusefsalaam/-------------Have you discovered your Sparketype yet? Take the Sparketype Assessment™ now.

Today she is known globally for her human rights advocacy and her ongoing campaign to ensure all children have equal access to education.She was born in the Swat Valley in northern Pakistan where her father Ziauddin was a prominent activist who believed boys and girls should sit side by side in the classroom and co-founded a school which Malala attended. After the Taliban began to establish its presence in the Valley, day-to-day life became synonymous with danger and fear – people were taken from their homes and killed for speaking out against the regime. Education for girls was forbidden and schools were shut down or bombed.In 2009 Malala began writing an anonymous blog for BBC Urdu in which she spoke out about what was happening in Swat Valley. This made her a target. In 2012 she was shot by a Taliban gunman as she sat on the school bus. Two girls sitting alongside her were also shot. What Malala calls ‘the incident’ generated headlines around the world. Her injuries were severe and she was airlifted to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. After a long and painful recovery she settled in Birmingham with her family.Now 23, Malala graduated from the University of Oxford last year and continues to campaign globally for girls’ education through the Malala Fund which she co-founded with her father.

Malala Yousafzai,"""Malala Yousafzai""",6VZkqtMYTcZd8fB4t9Jubl,"Sheryl Sandberg, Malala Yousafzai and Adam Grant on Facing Adversity, Building Resilience And Finding Joy","‘I learned about the depths of sadness and the brutality of loss. But I also learned that when life sucks you under, you can kick against the bottom, break the surface and breathe again.’ – Sheryl Sandberg Sheryl Sandberg is the COO at Facebook and international bestselling author of 'Lean In'. In 2015 disaster struck when her husband, Dave Goldberg, died suddenly at the age of 47. Sheryl and her two young children were devastated, and she was certain that their lives would never have real joy or meaning again. Just weeks later, Sandberg was talking with a friend about the first father-child activity without a father. They came up with a plan for someone to fill in. ‘But I want Dave,’ she cried. Her friend put his arm around her and said, ‘Option A is not available. So let’s just kick the shit out of Option B.’ Everyone experiences some form of Option B. We all deal with loss: jobs lost, loves lost, lives lost. The question is not whether these things will happen but how we face them when they do. Sandberg’s new book, 'Option B', weaves her experiences of coping with adversity with new findings from her co-author, the award-winning psychologist Adam Grant, and other social scientists. The book features stories of people who recovered from personal and professional hardship, including illness, injury, divorce, job loss, sexual assault and imprisonment. These people did more than recover – many of them became stronger. In this special Intelligence Squared event on June 24th, Sandberg was joined by Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani schoolgirl who was shot by the Taliban for speaking up for women’s education. She refused to be silenced, and her recovery, bravery and stoicism have made her an international role model. In 2014 she became the youngest ever winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. Sandberg and Yousafzai, in conversation with Grant, will explore how even after the most devastating events, we can learn to find deeper meaning and appreciation in our lives and rediscover joy. They will discuss how we can help others in crisis, raise strong children, and create resilient families, communities, and workplaces. Many of these lessons can be applied to our everyday struggles, allowing us to brave whatever lies ahead. Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/intelligencesquared.

Malala Yousafzai,"""Malala Yousafzai""",4Y11TnLeZWez73T5oGPhY1,"Malala Yousafzai - One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world","Welcome to the Daily Quote – a podcast designed to kickstart your day in a positive way. I'm your host, Andrew McGivern, for October 5th.Today is World Teachers' Day, a global observance that honors the teaching profession and recognizes the profound impact educators have on society. This meaningful day was proclaimed by UNESCO in 1994 to commemorate the 30th anniversary of a landmark moment in educational history.On October 5th, 1966, a special intergovernmental conference convened by UNESCO in Paris adopted the UNESCO/ILO Recommendation concerning the Status of Teachers. This groundbreaking document established international standards for teachers' rights, responsibilities, working conditions, and professional development. It was the first time the global community formally recognized teaching as a profession deserving specific protections and support.Today, World Teachers' Day is celebrated in over 100 countries worldwide, serving as a reminder that teachers are not just employees – they are architects of the future, shaping minds and hearts in ways that ripple through generations.Today's quote comes from education reformer Malala Yousafzai, who said:""One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world.""Malala's powerful statement captures the essence of why World Teachers' Day matters so profoundly. She speaks from lived experience – she nearly lost her life because she insisted on her right to education, and she understands better than most that the relationship between one student and one teacher can be revolutionary.Think about the simplicity and power of what she describes: one child, one teacher. Not massive institutional reforms, not billion-dollar programs, not complex policy initiatives. Just the fundamental human connection between someone eager to learn and someone willing to teach. That's where transformation begins.The beauty of Malala's insight is that it recognizes both the power and the accessibility of education. You don't need state-of-the-art facilities or cutting-edge technology to change the world – you need a teacher who cares, a student who's ready, and the basic tools of learning. Throughout history, revolutionary ideas and world-changing innovations have often emerged from this simple formula.UNESCO established World Teachers' Day because they understood what Malala articulates so clearly: teachers are change agents. Every time a teacher opens a student's mind to new possibilities, they're not just imparting knowledge – they're potentially changing the entire trajectory of that student's life, and by extension, the world that student will help shape.As you start your Sunday, think about Ward's wisdom and the teachers who have shaped your life. Today is the perfect day to reach out to an educator who made a difference for you – even if it's been years or decades.Maybe it's writing a letter or email to a former teacher, letting them know how they influenced your path. Maybe it's supporting a current teacher you know – they're often overworked and under-resourced. Maybe it's simply reflecting with gratitude on the people who believed in you and helped you become who you are.Teachers rarely get to see the full impact of their work. They plant seeds that might not bloom for years or decades. Today, let's take a moment to honor that profound act of faith – investing in human potential without knowing exactly how it will unfold.Thanks for starting your day with The Daily Quote. I'm Andrew McGivern. Make it a great day, and remember – behind every person who changes the world is a teacher who believed they could.That's going to do it for today. I'm Andrew McGivern signing off for now but I'll be back tomorrow.

From the very start, Jay sets the tone with an intention rooted in empathy, to help people not just know Malala, but understand her. Together, they revisit her extraordinary journey, from growing up in Pakistan’s Swat Valley under Taliban rule to surviving an assassination attempt at fifteen. Malala shares what it was like to wake up in a hospital far from home, and how she slowly began to realize that the world had already decided who she was before she could decide for herself. As the conversation unfolds, Malala opens up about the emotional aftermath of her survival, the years spent trying to live up to the image of bravery the world created for her while quietly struggling with fear, trauma, and loneliness. She reflects on how therapy helped her begin to process the pain she had long suppressed, and how rediscovering humor, friendship, and love became essential parts of her healing. Malala also talks about her marriage, her insecurities after the attack, and the importance of learning to love herself before fully believing that someone else could. Her honesty reveals a side rarely seen, that even those who inspire millions still wrestle with doubt and self-acceptance. Malala and Jay explore what courage truly means, not as a public act of heroism, but as a quiet, daily choice to keep going. She reflects on her mission to ensure education for every girl, the ongoing fight for women’s rights in Afghanistan, and how real change begins with local voices and global solidarity. Through her words, Malala reminds us that strength and softness can coexist, that healing is never linear, and that every person has the power to turn pain into purpose. In this interview, you'll learn: How to Stay Brave When You’re Afraid How to Heal From Trauma With Time and Therapy How to Find Yourself Beyond What the World Expects How to Rebuild Confidence After Losing It How to Create Change Through Education How to Love Yourself After Feeling Unworthy How to Redefine Courage in Everyday Life How to Keep Hope Alive in Dark Times How to Be the Voice for Those Who Can’t Speak No matter what you’ve been through, your story isn’t over, it’s still being written every single day.

She delightfully dispensed what she called free relationship advice about having an age gap in marriage, alluding to the fact that by marrying someone slightly older she gets to experience legendary rock concerts like Oasis—an event she described as eighty thousand people singing Wonderwall in unison under Dublin fireworks. Their escapade included a windswept hike along the Cliffs of Howth, seafood by the sea, and visits to the historic library at Trinity College. Social media was abuzz with fans celebrating their chemistry and her humor, especially her response that Oasis had released their first three albums before she was even born, with her signature quick wit shining through.But Malala’s public persona is more than light-hearted travel and pop culture. She continues to leverage her international platform for urgent causes. On September 15, 2025, according to the Malala Fund’s official news, she and her father Ziauddin Yousafzai announced $230,000 in emergency grants to support education recovery after devastating floods in Pakistan. This direct intervention targets communities where hundreds of schools were destroyed or damaged, with a focus on keeping girls in school despite climate-driven setbacks. Not only did Malala and her family visit the hardest-hit regions to meet with families and volunteers, but her appeals for climate action resonated across Pakistan’s media landscape. Dunya News also reported her calling for increased relief efforts in flood-affected areas.On the advocacy front, Malala was at the center of several major statements this week. She took to X, formerly Twitter, to urge India and Pakistan to de-escalate tensions, arguing poignantly that hatred and violence are the true enemies and calling for diplomacy and dialogue in the region—a message that garnered international attention according to The Business Standard. Meanwhile, the Malala Fund condemned the Taliban’s cutoff of internet for girls in Afghanistan, calling the move “another attempt under their brutal gender apartheid” to erase girls from learning and public life, as reported by Amu TV.Organizationally, the Malala Fund revealed it had reached over 26 million students globally in the last fiscal year, supporting pivotal policy reforms from Nigeria to Brazil and Afghanistan. According to Nairametrics, the Fund unlocked $7 billion in donor commitments and is now embarking on a new $50 million initiative for the next five years, with specific investments targeting crisis-affected girls’ education in Nigeria.Across Threads and Instagram, Malala continued to share glimpses into her personal and professional life, often highlighting joyful moments as well as her unwavering dedication to education and girls’ rights. While speculation persists over where her humanitarian influence might expand next, verified reports overwhelmingly emphasize her nuanced balance of public advocacy, program leadership, and authentic glimpses of her private world. As always, Malala’s headlines this week are a blend of youthful joy, sharp commentary, and a relentless drive to break barriers for millions worldwide.Get the best deals https://amzn.to/3ODvOtaThis content was created in partnership and with the help of Artificial Intelligence AI",https://open.spotify.com/episode/3I19B8MDm6j6rBxoomvF06,2025-09-20,2AV6Hq6KWVvkf64rnVBhZt,Malala Yousafzai  - Audio Biography,Inception Point Ai,1761057411.0808792

Speaking to the press and her millions of followers online, Malala emphasized her mission: calling on leaders to defend the right of every girl to attend school, and pressing the international community to hold the Taliban accountable for their ongoing oppression of Afghan women and girls.As if to underscore her impact, Malala also made headlines by announcing a two hundred thousand dollar grant through the Malala Fund after devastating floods in Pakistan, channeled to Mountain Institute for Education and Development. Her statement, shared by Geo News, was a rallying promise to help rebuild destroyed schools and support children, especially girls, in resuming their education. She’s been emphatic that disaster relief must include restoring learning for all.Amplifying her advocacy for Afghan women, Malala spoke out passionately when the Taliban shut down fiber optic internet across numerous Afghan provinces. The Malala Fund issued a forceful statement condemning this as another gendered attack, with Malala herself calling the action “the Taliban’s latest attempt under their brutal gender apartheid to sever Afghan women and girls from the world.” She issued an urgent plea to governments everywhere to pressure the Taliban for restoration, reported by Amu TV.But the Nobel laureate has also allowed space for more personal moments. On September 21, Malala delivered an exclusive public reading from her forthcoming memoir Finding My Way at the Chelsea Arts Festival in London. Chelsea audiences were treated to a lighter, unexpected story—her first meeting with her now husband, set during a comically disastrous go-karting adventure at Oxford. Country and Town House detailed how Malala’s reading charmed a room already electrified by calls for women’s voices to ring out louder than ever.In the film world, Malala was announced by Variety as executive producer—alongside Succession’s Arian Moayed—of the buzzy new documentary Champions of the Golden Valley, which charts the dreams and unity of Afghan athletes defying adversity. The documentary just finished a high-profile Oscar-qualifying run in Los Angeles after scooping multiple festival awards.As for social media, her verified Threads account and X remained active as she reacted live to news from Pakistan, wished followers happy birthdays, and encouraged global solidarity for girls’ rights on September 16 and 18.Each of these moments, whether a stirring speech in Islamabad, a sharp call-out of Taliban restrictions, or an intimate literary debut, continues to shape the evolving legacy of a woman still driving headlines, striking hope, and steering global attention with both force and grace.

The biggest headline currently is her emotional return to Pakistan for a global summit on girls’ education in the Islamic world. According to Asharq Al-Awsat, Malala told reporters on arrival in Islamabad she felt overwhelmed and happy to be back home and is set to address the summit, reiterating her commitment to girls’ rights and calling for international accountability for the Taliban’s abuses against Afghan women and girls. She previewed her speech on X, emphasizing the necessity of universal access to education, especially in light of Afghanistan’s ongoing education ban for women.On the humanitarian front, Malala made a high-impact visit to Cairo, where she met Palestinian refugee children displaced from Gaza, witnessing firsthand the devastation wrought by Israel’s ongoing campaign. Dawn reports she pledged $100,000 through the Malala Fund to support INARA, the refugee aid organization, marking this as the first time in her work that every child she met had survived personal tragedy—from physical wounds to family losses. Her Instagram posts called out the suffering as “Israel’s genocide,” making a direct political statement while also pressing for a ceasefire and global action in support of Palestinian children. This came just a month after she pledged $3 million to support girls’ education and women’s rights in Afghanistan, strengthening her perceived biographical legacy as a champion for vulnerable youth.In a notable cultural appearance, Country & Town House reports Malala gave the world-exclusive first reading from her upcoming memoir Finding My Way at the Chelsea Arts Festival on September 21. She surprised audiences with a personal story about Oxford days and her future husband, providing rare insight into her private life and signaling that her forthcoming book, due October 21, will expand her public narrative beyond activism.Malala’s social media presence has been vibrant, with regular posts on Threads and Instagram about her travels, philanthropic endeavors, and recent advocacy for sign languages on the International Day of Sign Languages.

Headlines in major outlets have spotlighted her forceful advocacy, her fundraising impact, and her statesmanship in some of the world’s toughest policy arenas. Fresh off her arrival in Abuja last Friday, Malala, joined by her father Ziauddin and Malala Fund CEO Lena Alfi, was seen navigating high-level meetings with Nigerian education activists, government officials, and civil society. The Tribune, The Gazette, and Hetty’s Media were among those detailing how she leveraged her presence to push for gender-responsive policies, particularly for married and pregnant girls, and rallied concrete commitments to ending child marriage and improving education financing across Nigeria, a country where nearly 5 million girls remain out of school. Malala made it clear at a formal Abuja dinner event Monday that education reform was already “yielding results” but urgently demanded more implementation from governors and partners.If that wasn’t enough on the humanitarian front, Malala made a powerful stop in Cairo midweek, where she met Palestinian children displaced from Gaza. According to Arab News, Dawn Images, Asia News Network, and her own Instagram reporting, she announced a $100,000 grant from the Malala Fund to INARA, a group providing highly specialized trauma care and educational support to refugee youth. Malala delivered visceral firsthand accounts—children traumatized to muteness, the universal loss of family members, and a three-year-old girl who survived but lost her siblings. With her posts, Malala directly accused Israel of violating international law and decimating Gaza’s education system, calling for an end to the conflict, urging leaders to demand a permanent ceasefire, and openly using the term “genocide” in reference to the events in Gaza. Public responses and social media echoed and amplified her stance, which, while praised in many activist and international circles, continues to provoke heated debate in diplomatic and governmental quarters.Malala’s recent speeches at the global summit on girls’ education in Pakistan—reported by TBS News and Arab News—took a similarly uncompromising tone on Afghanistan. She implored Muslim leaders not to “legitimise” the Taliban regime given its exclusion of women and girls from schools and the public sphere, framing the issue as both a humanitarian crisis and a test of global Islamic leadership. Instagram and Threads users are still buzzing about her unapologetic energy, with some of her recent platform posts teasing the Oct. 21 release of her new memoir “Finding My Way,” a project described as “years in the making.” Equality Now just announced she will be honored at their 2025 Make Equality Reality Gala as the Trailblazer Award recipient. In both her high-profile philanthropy and her frontline activism, Malala’s voice this week has been nothing short of electric—resonating from Abuja to Cairo to Islamabad and across social media as a clear signal of what biographical significance looks like in real time.Get the best deals https://amzn.to/3ODvOtaThis content was created in partnership and with the help of Artificial Intelligence AI",https://open.spotify.com/episode/6URow3Hn6Xcb9DoDmIZdA7,2025-09-30,2AV6Hq6KWVvkf64rnVBhZt,Malala Yousafzai  - Audio Biography,Inception Point Ai,1761057411.1315162

Aged 17 when she received the award, she became the youngest ever person to receive a Nobel in any category. A BBC blogger since 2009, she has been a persistent critic of the Taliban in her country, which resulted in an attempt on her life when she was on a bus near her home in Pakistan in 2012. She studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Lady Margaret Hall College, Oxford, and has an honorary doctorate from Kings College University, Halifax, Canada.   We open this episode with an excerpt from an event at Winter Weekend 2018 from Malala’s father, Ziauddin Yousafzai. For more than 20 years, Ziauddin Yousafzai has been fighting for equality – first for Malala, his daughter – and then for all girls throughout the world living in patriarchal societies. Taught as a young boy in Pakistan to believe that he was inherently better than his sisters, Ziauddin rebelled against inequality at a young age. And when he had a daughter himself he vowed that Malala would have an education, something usually only given to boys, and he founded a school that Malala could attend.

Yousafzai began advocating for girls’ education when she was still a child, which resulted in the Taliban issuing a death threat against her. In October 2012, a gunman shot Yousafzai when she was traveling home from school. The activist survived, became a Nobel laureate at age 17, and continues her work through her international nonprofit, Malala Fund. She has written several books, including the best-selling memoir I Am Malala, and helped produce the 2022 Oscar-nominated documentary short Stranger at the Gate.Early Life and ActivismMalala Yousafzai was born on July 12, 1997, in Mingora, Pakistan, located in the country’s northern Swat Valley. For the first few years of her life, Yousafzai’s hometown remained a popular tourist spot that was known for its summer festivals. The area began to change as the Taliban tried to take control.Yousafzai’s father, Ziauddin, is an educator, but her mother, Tor Pekai, was illiterate until she was in her 40s. The couple always supported their daughter’s education. Malala attended a school that her father had founded.After the Taliban began attacking girls schools in Swat, 11-year-old Yousafzai gave a speech in Peshawar, Pakistan, in September 2008. The title of her talk was, “How Dare the Taliban Take Away My Basic Right to Education?” In early 2009, Yousafzai began blogging for the BBC about living under the Taliban’s threats to deny her an education. In order to hide her identity, she used the name Gul Makai. However, her identity was revealed that December.With a growing public platform, Yousafzai continued to speak out about her right, and the right of all women, to an education. Her activism resulted in a nomination for the International Children’s Peace Prize in 2011. That same year, she was awarded Pakistan’s National Youth Peace Prize.Yousafzai and her family learned that the Taliban had issued a death threat against her because of her activism. Although Malala was frightened for the safety of her father—an anti-Taliban activist—she and her family initially felt that the fundamentalist group would not actually harm a child.Shot by the TalibanOn October 9, 2012, when 15-year-old Yousafzai was riding a bus with friends on their way home from school, a masked gunman boarded the bus and demanded to know which girl was Yousafzai. When friends looked toward her, Yousafzai was given away. The gunman fired at her, hitting the girl in the left side of her head; the bullet then traveled down her neck. Two other girls were also injured in the attack.",https://open.spotify.com/episode/6VfE3spCYfQbzXrpf8POSY,2025-10-03,6m3O5GAd3ljJkB39m4QMVI,Nibir Enterprise,Nibir Enterprise,1761057411.1624973

Malala Yousafzai,"""Malala Yousafzai""",2Q6S1jJyH1jfox7N5bh1fR,Malala's Memoir: Reframing Her Legacy at 25 | Nobel Buzz & Book Tour,Malai Yousafzai BioSnap a weekly updated Biography.This past week has been a significant stretch for me Malala Yousafzai with my name surfacing in global headlines and across social media in the runup to the highly anticipated Nobel Peace Prize 2025 announcement. While I am often cited as the youngest recipient in Nobel Peace history according to the Nobel Peace Center the press is already abuzz with speculation about this year’s laureate and the role of young women’s activism in current world events but as policy Nobel officials never reveal nominations and all lists are pure conjecture for the next five decades. Nonetheless every shortlist conversation seems to end up revisiting my legacy and drawing comparisons to emerging figures in the peace and climate space. Book news has dominated my public agenda. The imminent launch of my memoir Finding My Way is triggering a nationwide book tour with both in-person and virtual appearances slated throughout October and November. This Wednesday October 22 I will headline online author talks hosted by several libraries including the New Berlin Public Library where I will discuss my journey of identity resilience and shaking off labels imposed by my most traumatic moments. This appearance offers readers a first glimpse at the memoir which revisits adolescence under threat and details the challenge of carving out an authentic adulthood post-Nobel as confirmed on the event’s registration sites and through advance press.Meanwhile an in-person highlight looms for November 18 at the Mondavi Center where University of California Davis Chancellor Gary S May will moderate a candid conversation about education advocacy and the evolving role of global youth. Unsurprisingly according to Feedspot’s latest ranking I am still the top human rights influencer on Instagram where my follower count has just hit 3.4 million and my profile currently points to preorders for the new book. On Threads my posts remain tongue-in-cheek with a viral October 3 post referencing Track 5 and some cheerful banter on being an eldest daughter sparking a string of supportive reactions.In the wider news ecosystem dialogue about the legacy of young Nobel laureates has resurfaced following the arrest of Greta Thunberg last week with media and Twitter users drawing contrast and debate about activism styles. For me 2025 is shaping up to be a year of reframing the narrative as critics and fans alike prepare for my latest literary chapter and continued work on the global stage. No official business ventures product launches or new corporate partnerships have been reported in recent days and any rumors beyond public book events or Nobel speculation remain unverified or speculative at best.Get the best deals https://amzn.to/3ODvOtaThis content was created in partnership and with the help of Artificial Intelligence AI,https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Q6S1jJyH1jfox7N5bh1fR,2025-10-04,2AV6Hq6KWVvkf64rnVBhZt,Malala Yousafzai  - Audio Biography,Inception Point Ai,1761057411.1885538

There is that familiar flurry surrounding her virtual Author Talks—she kicked off live conversations with audiences through library events like those at the New Berlin Public Library and Evergreen Valley College, where she offered raw insights into reclaiming her own narrative in a world eager to define her by trauma rather than growth. These events have been well publicized and drew major attention, with fans eager for glimpses into her life beyond activism, touching on subjects like youthful missteps, heartache, and the realities of adulthood. According to coverage by Evergreen Valley College, Malala’s memoir uses humor and candor to depict the bumpy road from high school outsider to Oxford graduate, pausing at vulnerable moments that remind the public she’s as complicated and real as anyone else.Of particular note is her upcoming appearance in New York’s Capital Region on October 22, where Malala will speak live with numerous public libraries. Local radio station WGNA describes a region-wide excitement, as anticipating crowds look forward to interactive discussions that promise to move beyond generic heroics and dive into her journey toward personal agency. Such book talks have already begun generating major local headlines, not just for her activism but the tonal shift toward self-discovery and resilience rather than survival alone.Malala’s prominence remains unfaded, yet debates about her role back home persist. NPR’s Code Switch explored the contrasting perceptions between Western adulation and Pakistani skepticism, highlighting long-standing suspicions among her compatriots about her fame’s global context and what it means for representation.On the business and philanthropic side, there’s renewed buzz about her charitable work, especially as Nobel season approaches. Although the Norwegian Nobel Committee keeps current nominees secret, news from the Nobel Peace Center reminds us Malala still holds the public imagination as the youngest-ever Nobel laureate, now serving as both a symbol of hope and, increasingly, a multidimensional public figure.Social media continues to amplify her every move, with hashtags related to her book launch, TV interviews, and author talks trending in the education and youth activism spaces. While nothing has surfaced regarding scandal or controversy, there’s an undercurrent of debate in some op-eds, like Dawn’s recent commentary, weighing the cultural contrasts between Malala and peers such as Greta Thunberg, further cementing her as a perennial subject of both admiration and scrutiny. The blend of book buzz, public appearances, and critical dialogue ensures Malala’s story feels as urgent and unfinished as ever.Get the best deals https://amzn.to/3ODvOtaThis content was created in partnership and with the help of Artificial Intelligence AI",https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UVa4AiMZwtADSrvgk3TY0,2025-10-07,2AV6Hq6KWVvkf64rnVBhZt,Malala Yousafzai  - Audio Biography,Inception Point Ai,1761057411.2365155

Née en mille neuf cent quatre-vingt-dix-sept dans la vallée de Swat, au Pakistan, Malala a grandi dans un environnement où les droits des femmes étaient limités et où les talibans cherchaient à étouffer toute opposition. En dépit de cette réalité, Malala a développé très tôt une passion pour l'éducation, encouragée par son père, Ziauddin Yousafzai, qui dirigeait une école pour filles. Alors que les talibans commençaient à prendre le contrôle de la vallée de Swat, ils ont imposé des interdictions strictes sur l'éducation des filles. Mais Malala, à l'âge de onze ans, a refusé de rester silencieuse. Elle a commencé à tenir un blog anonyme pour la BBC en ourdou, détaillant les horreurs de la vie sous le régime taliban et la nécessité d'une éducation pour tous, indépendamment du sexe.

For 14 million women, it can be said that they are inching closer to hell...One year after the Taliban regained control, they started to impose rules that girls could only attend school up to the sixth grade. After elementary school, they had to stay at home and were not allowed to go out alone. When outside, they had to be accompanied by a male elder from their family; otherwise, they would be whipped on the streets. High schools were banned, and in December last year, they went a step further by banning university entrance exams. At the beginning of 2023, they ordered that women could not work in non-profit organizations. Most NGOs take care of vulnerable groups, such as children's and women's healthcare. The Taliban strictly prohibit any contact between men and women, so once there are no female workers, the female beneficiaries will also lose those who help them...Within a month of the order being issued, three international NGO organizations had closed. How many children might lose their lives as a result?Malala, a girl from the mountains of Pakistan, was shot at the age of 15 for protesting against the Taliban's deprivation of girls' right to education. Fortunately, she was promptly sent to the UK for medical treatment, not only saving her life but also strengthening her resolve. Malala decided to let the whole world know how girls in Taliban-controlled areas were losing their right to education. She wanted to use her example to show girls that they could change their destiny. With a pen, a book, a teacher, and a student, they could change the world!You might have heard of her, this brave woman who won the Nobel Peace Prize at the age of 17.

Malala Yousafzai,"""Malala Yousafzai""",1aTYBK9W5quGwMckaKWkdo,"Malala's Memoir: Defying Labels, Redefining Activism","Malai Yousafzai BioSnap a weekly updated Biography.In the past several days, Malala Yousafzai has been everywhere—from gala stages to news headlines and viral social media moments—cementing her legacy as both staunch activist and unexpectedly candid memoirist. On October 15, she was honored with the Trailblazer Award at Equality Now’s 2025 Make Equality Reality Gala in New York, where global leaders and stars gathered under the theme Choose Joy. Malala’s acceptance speech resonated, a celebration of joy as resistance in the fight for women’s rights and a reminder that influence should be wielded with empathy and action. Ann Curry’s keynote highlighted Malala’s brand of hope as serious work.Buzz surged on October 16 when BBC World Service released an interview with Malala in Nigeria, underscoring her ongoing projects for girls’ education in the country with the world’s highest rate of out-of-school children. With disarming honesty, she conceded the difficulty of making friends under the microscope of global fame, her mental health struggles, and the complexities of campaigning—especially as she faces online backlash for her outspoken support for Gaza. She reiterated her million-dollar support for Palestinian children through the Malala Fund, set her stance on political neutrality, and put world leaders on notice for neglecting Afghan women’s rights in the face of Taliban resurgence. Social media amplified her message, sparking debates over her activism and her refusal to back down from controversy.The most anticipated headline of the week: Malala’s newest memoir, Finding My Way, launches October 21. Pre-release excerpts making waves in Pakistan Today and The Guardian give intimate access into late-night Oxford escapades, her candid weed confession, secret dating, and candid insights on evolving worldviews since her Nobel Peace Prize win. Malala opens up in vivid detail about a panic attack triggered after smoking weed at Oxford, how she processed trauma, and her relationship with her now-husband, Asser Malik. She even shares the “sex bomb” moment when she defied her mother’s wardrobe rules for a romantic dinner, reflecting on balancing tradition, secrecy, and her own desires. The Times of India singles out her advice about love, self-acceptance, and resisting the pressure of labels.Malala’s second memoir signals a shift: she describes becoming an optimistic realist, less naïve about diplomacy and more focused on concrete impact, like paying tuition for family friends in need and campaigning for the international recognition of “gender apartheid.” While she expects criticism in Pakistan, Malala radiates a quiet confidence, inviting anyone with questions to read her book.Business-wise, tickets for her speaking event in Washington, DC, on October 27 are trending on Vivid Seats as fans rush to hear her live. She’s slated for a major virtual author talk on October 22 with Alameda Free Library, promising even more revelations. Her name is trending on Instagram and X, fueling lively discussion on activism, mental health, and modern love. No credible speculation or disputed reports have gained traction—everything here is verified with Malala’s own words and direct reporting. This week will likely endure as a time when Malala boldly redefined her narrative, message, and activism for a generation.Get the best deals https://amzn.to/3ODvOtaThis content was created in partnership and with the help of Artificial Intelligence AI",https://open.spotify.com/episode/1aTYBK9W5quGwMckaKWkdo,2025-10-21,2AV6Hq6KWVvkf64rnVBhZt,Malala Yousafzai  - Audio Biography,Inception Point Ai,1761057412.2785172

Through this book tour, my story can move from the page into genuine conversation and connection."" This new memoir, billed as her most personal work yet, promises to share everything from failing exams to romance, and it's already trending for pre-order and tour ticket sales. Press across Connecticut and national US media, including Greenwich Time and CT Post, have been highlighting her imminent visit to the Shubert Theatre in New Haven on October 26, causing a local frenzy.There was also a powerful speech at the 40th Anniversary Elle Style Awards in London, reported by Elle UK, where she closed the show with exceptional humility while accepting the Inspirational Icon award from rapper Little Simz. Her address touched on feeling lost and overwhelmed despite public accolades and stressed that “the only answer... is to get up every morning and do everything we can to help.” Malala spotlighted work by her Malala Fund, notably funding underground schools for girls in Afghanistan and educational programs for Gaza refugees. Audiences and social media responded with standing ovations and countless posts amplifying her hopeful message.On the activism front, Malala has been outspoken on international issues with global resonance. According to Arab News, she gave a moving speech at a summit in Islamabad, unequivocally condemning Israel’s destruction of Gaza’s education system and vowing to continue calling out human rights violations. Her remarks about Palestinian children and the devastation in Gaza sparked widespread debate and international coverage. She also confirmed her support for Palestine on social platforms after some negative buzz and clarified that advocacy for children’s rights and education remains her top priority, as covered by AOL.Additionally, Malala weighed in through a statement on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, urging India and Pakistan to de-escalate tensions, saying, “Hatred and violence are our common enemies, not each other.” This post was referenced by TBS News and circulated widely.On a lighter note, Malala’s candid style at public events—from retweeting fan posts about her book tour to sharing behind-the-scenes prep for her speaking engagements—has made her a trending topic across Instagram and X. Though there’s always speculation regarding her personal life during such launches, credible outlets continue to focus on her activism and memoir, underscoring the long-term significance of her voice rather than fueling tabloid rumors. Overall, the current news cycle depicts Malala at the height of her influence, using both memoir and global stage to redefine what it means to be a modern icon and relentless advocate for girls everywhere.Get the best deals https://amzn.to/3ODvOtaThis content was created in partnership and with the help of Artificial Intelligence AI",https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YCx0Rz033nOQ5o9VONI8v,2025-09-13,2AV6Hq6KWVvkf64rnVBhZt,Malala Yousafzai  - Audio Biography,Inception Point Ai,1761057412.2846704

Malala Yousafzai,"""Malala Yousafzai""",2frpDip5xjbIz6CZwYvmqH,"Malala's Memoir: Unveiling Her Truth, Battling Critics, and Redefining Activism","Malai Yousafzai BioSnap a weekly updated Biography.Over the past several days Malala Yousafzai has dominated headlines and animated social media thanks to the upcoming release of her second memoir Finding My Way which publishes on October 21. The Guardian and Marie Claire both ran in-depth interviews in which Malala—now 28—spoke with surprising candor about the messy realities behind her carefully curated public image. She revisits the trauma of the Taliban’s 2012 assassination attempt and reveals, for the first time, that a moment of experimentation with cannabis as an undergraduate triggered a flood of repressed memories and panic attacks. Both British and South Asian outlets have highlighted this weed confession and the vulnerable discussion of her mental health struggles, with Times of India and Pakistan Today emphasizing how she battled anxiety, brain fog, and constant fear, and how therapy became essential to her recovery.The rollout of Finding My Way has also reignited debate about Malala’s shifting worldview—from the idealistic teenager who called world leaders to demand justice, to a more cynical but still relentless advocate who admits that power rarely listens to young women unless it’s for a photo op. She vents this frustration in her memoir, and yet insists, as quoted by MindSite News, that optimism is the only way forward—no matter how often calls to leaders go unanswered when Afghan or Gazan girls are forgotten.A public virtual author talk is set for October 22 and she will appear in person at the University of Michigan’s Ford School on October 24, with stops at New York’s Town Hall and New Haven’s Shubert Theatre for her book tour. These events are attracting considerable attention, and the memoir is tipped to be a bestseller, but is already controversial. Her remarks in an earlier Guardian interview about marriage being “just a partnership” and her casual mention of pub visits sparked the usual backlash in Pakistan. Hashtags like shameonMalala have trended as clerics, politicians, and conservative commentators accused her of betraying her faith and country, while supporters rushed to clarify her comments and shield her family from criticism. Malala herself waded into the controversy online, sharing the articles and thanking journalists, but refusing to apologize or walk anything back.A different controversy is playing out in activist circles online, where users criticize her perceived “softness” on Gaza. As Lanka News Web and Marie Claire note, activists charge that tweets and donations are not enough, despite her Malala Fund funneling hundreds of thousands of dollars to aid and her repeated public statements calling for a ceasefire and characterizing the bombings as genocide. She visited Egypt just days ago to meet injured Palestinian refugees and announced a new $100000 grant for their support.While critics on both left and right try to paint her as westernized, transactional, or out of touch, Malala continues to insist that her activism is born of her roots and deeply communal. She is supporting other women, standing by Afghan girls, and challenging not only regimes but world leaders who treat her as just a photo op. This is a week where Malala Yousafzai is not letting anyone else set her narrative—she is human, flawed, and fighting not just for girls’ education but for her own sense of self, and her candid new memoir may be the most significant contribution to her biography yet.Get the best deals https://amzn.to/3ODvOtaThis content was created in partnership and with the help of Artificial Intelligence AI",https://open.spotify.com/episode/2frpDip5xjbIz6CZwYvmqH,2025-10-18,2AV6Hq6KWVvkf64rnVBhZt,Malala Yousafzai  - Audio Biography,Inception Point Ai,1761057412.312341

Most notably, she just announced $75000 in new emergency grants from the Malala Fund to help girls in Pakistan recover their education after severe flooding, reinforcing her ongoing commitment to girls’ rights and humanitarian relief, as confirmed directly by Malala.org. Global attention also turns to her personal storytelling with the rapid approach of her live virtual events—she is scheduled to headline a widely anticipated live talk via the Charles County Public Library on October 22, 2025, at 7 pm Eastern, where she’ll discuss her advocacy, her evolving sense of self, and most importantly, her new memoir “Finding My Way,” as reported by both the Charles County Public Library and event listings from Campbell County Public Library. The upcoming memoir has attracted significant early buzz, promising readers a candid exploration of Malala’s life not just as a Nobel laureate and activist, but as a young woman navigating love, anxiety, self-identity, and the feeling of being pulled between worlds—a story that the event teasers call “astonishing” and “vulnerable.” According to the Campbell County Public Library, the book exposes her vulnerability and humor, from nearly failing school exams to falling in love, painting a personal portrait rarely glimpsed by the public. Ursinus College’s calendar further confirms Malala’s event schedule, with the same October 9, 2025, author talk fueling anticipation for her memoir’s official debut.Public appearances are far from confined to the virtual realm. Major ticket platforms such as Vivid Seats and Live Nation are listing in-person events, most notably her “Finding My Way Book Tour” stop at The Fillmore Philadelphia on October 28, 2025, underlining her return to large venues and direct audience interaction. Headlines this week have both celebrated her public-facing activism and previewed the personal revelations set to define this new memoir era.Across social media, Malala’s grants announcement and author events have trended among education, nonprofit, and book communities, with influencers highlighting her ability to balance leadership, vulnerability, and activism.

Primeiramente, A infância de Malala, A história de Malala Yousafzai, como descrita em 'Malala e seu lápis mágico', começa com sua infância na cidade de Mingora, no Paquistão. Através de seus olhos, o leitor é levado a conhecer uma menina comum que sonhava com um mundo melhor para todos ao seu redor. Desde cedo, Malala foi influenciada por seu pai, que era educador e acreditava no direito à educação para todos, independentemente de gênero. A fome de conhecimento de Malala era evidente desde pequena e, como muitas crianças, ela acreditava que um lápis mágico poderia resolver todos os problemas do mundo. Ela desejava um mundo onde desigualdades e injustiças não existissem, possibilitado pela educação. Esta fase da sua vida é importante porque mostra como as esperanças e sonhos de uma criança podem significar o começo de grandes mudanças. Mesmo sendo jovem, a compreensão de Malala sobre o poder da educação já estava presente, simbolizando o lápis mágico mais do que um simples objeto, mas uma ferramenta de transformação.  Em segundo lugar, O sonho de ter um lápis mágico, O conceito do lápis mágico em 'Malala e seu lápis mágico' serve como uma poderosa metáfora. Na narrativa, o lápis mágico representa o desejo de Malala de ter os meios para consertar as injustiças que ela vê em sua comunidade. O sonho de ter um lápis capaz de mudar a realidade reflete a imaginação e o senso de justiça de uma criança diante de um mundo imperfeito. Para Malala, um lápis mágico simboliza uma forma de reinventar o futuro, algo que todos podem relacionar ao seu próprio desejo de transformação pessoal e social. Este tema aborda a importância de sonhar e acreditar que pequenas ações podem ter grandes repercussões. No decorrer do livro, a mágica inicialmente entendida como algo extraordinário passa a ser vista como possível através do esforço e da educação. Ela ensina que, mesmo sem um lápis mágico literal, podemos usar o 'lápis' da educação para redesenhar o nosso mundo. Assim, o livro não apenas incentiva a imaginação, mas também reforça a mensagem de que o verdadeiro poder está no conhecimento e na ação.  Em terceiro lugar, As dificuldades enfrentadas por Malala, Malala Yousafzai enfrentou inúmeros desafios na busca por seu direito à educação. 'Malala e seu lápis mágico' toca em algumas destas dificuldades, permitindo que o leitor jovem compreenda a gravidade das situações enfrentadas. No Paquistão, sob o regime do Talibã, as meninas eram proibidas de frequentar a escola, o que Malala desafiou corajosamente ao defender seu direito e o de outras garotas à educação. O livro ilustra de forma sensível como Malala teve que lidar com a presença constante do medo e da injustiça, enfrentando adversidades com coragem e determinação. Essas dificuldades também incluíram o atentado que sofreu em 2012, quando foi alvo de um ataque por defender seus princípios. Apesar disso, Malala nunca desistiu de sua missão. A narrativa, ao abordar estes desafios, não termina em desespero, mas em esperança e resiliência. Malala mostra que mesmo em face de grandes obstáculos, a força de vontade e a crença em um mundo melhor podem inspirar ações significativas e transformadoras, compondo uma poderosa lição sobre perseverança e coragem.

When I almost died it was just after midday.' When the Taliban took control of the Swat Valley in Pakistan, one girl spoke out. Malala Yousafzai refused to be silenced and fought for her right to an education. On Tuesday, October 9, 2012, when she was fifteen, she almost paid the ultimate price. She was shot in the head at point-blank range while riding the bus home from school, and few expected her to survive. Instead, Malala's miraculous recovery has taken her on an extraordinary journey from a remote valley in northern Pakistan to the halls of the United Nations in New York. At sixteen, she became a global symbol of peaceful protest and the youngest nominee ever for the Nobel Peace Prize. I AM MALALA is the remarkable tale of a family uprooted by global terrorism, of the fight for girls' education, of a father who, himself a school owner, championed and encouraged his daughter to write and attend school, and of brave parents who have a fierce love for their daughter in a society that prizes sons. I AM MALALA will make you believe in the power of one person's voice to inspire change in the world.

Directed by Sahra Mani and co-produced by Jennifer Lawrence, the film follows three Afghan women (filmed in secret) as they live under and resist the Taliban oppression. “I believe that while the Taliban are trying to silence women, amplifying their voices through this documentary, is a form of resistance.” For Mani, the message of this film is of vital global importance. “Afghan women [are] paying the price the high price today, the world might pay the price tomorrow... We need solidarity of the world right now, tomorrow might be [too] late.” For Yousafzai, a Nobel Peace Prize recipient who rose to prominence after surviving a failed Taliban assassination attempt at 12 years old, this is an issue that is rooted in the inalienable right to dignity and personal freedom. “We all remain committed to it, and we'll keep fighting til the day we see every Afghan girl going to her school again, and every Afghan women getting their equal rights, living in dignity.”See Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",https://open.spotify.com/episode/5HlaGb44D1thKFnhfcyLoW,2024-11-22,3baeI8Lb1Uys8M4WUdL9XR,The Parting Shot with H.

Hello I’m Romey Hinz and today we are going to be talking about Malala Yousafzai. Have you ever heard of Malala Yousafzai? She is very well known around the world. She is an activist from Pakistan and I will get into detail later so stay tuned for more fun!Here we are going to talk about when Malala was younger. Malala was born in swat valley on July 12 1997 she grew up in Mongoria, Pakistan with her 2 little brothers her and her family practiced the religion of Islam she was part of an ethnic group called the Pashtums her early childhood was happy she knew 3 languages.  Her father ran many schools and was a teacher at one of them and Malala went to one of his schools for girls. She loved learning and going to school. She wanted to become a doctor or a teacher or a politician, and  her father wanted her to learn more.Around the time Malala was 10 years old the Taliban started to take control. The Taliban were strict Muslims who demanded that all people follow Islamic Sharia law. They said that women have to stay home and if they left they had to wear a Burqa (a dress like garment that covers the body head) and they had to be accompanied by a male relative. And that's about it for this section we will be right back after this ad! The Taliban were not happy with Malala because she did not like their rules. Malala was told to stop speaking out and she received numerous death threats. One day after school on October 9 2012  Malala took the bus home then a man with a gun got on the bus and said “Who is Malala?” He said if they did not tell him he would kill them all then they told him and Malala was shot.  The bullet hit Malala in the head and she got very sick. She woke up a week later in a hospital in England the doctors weren't sure if she would live or have brain damage but she survived but still after many surgeries she was attending school 6 months later. Getting shot did not stop Malala. On her 16th birthday she gave a speech to the United Nations. She said she wanted all girls to get an education  and she didn't want revenge on the Taliban or the man who shot her; she just wanted peace and opportunity for all. Malala's fame and impact continued to grow she has received a number of awards including the Nobel peace prize in 2014 she became the youngest person to receive Nobel peace prize. Malala is not doing much these days as she has just completed her degree at oxford university and she  is married to Asser Malik and Malala is 24 she says she will be watching Netflix,reading and sleeping. Malala is now a graduate in philosophy, politics and economics from the University of Oxford, London. Well folks that's it for today hope you learned a little bit about Malala Yousafzai today! She is a very interesting person! So come back next week to learn about Wilma Rudolph!",https://open.spotify.com/episode/4wmacpSY1Kl5hC2BXIB8mx,2022-02-25,5UG78oUanJrOhBL6YOKXKV,Malala Yousafzai,Romey Hinz,1761057414.7088356

Together, they ask: How much truth can we carry before it starts to hurt?The conversation expands on Episode 18’s story of Malala Yousafzai, whose courage to speak up changed her life — and the world. What does she have in common with Jane Austen? And how does authenticity unfold through art, leadership, and literature? Karina also shares her honest (and slightly conflicted) thoughts on Liz Gilbert’s At the Way to the River. And one of our listeners shares her story and gives us this week's Tiny Experiment!The Tiny ExperimentThis week’s practice:Notice when you start to shrink your words or ideas.Instead of saying, “Just a small thought…”, try saying,“I have something to say.”Observe what changes in your tone, posture, and confidence.Tools & Takeaways• Authenticity doesn’t mean exposure — it means alignment.• Cherish your truth and protect your process.• Body language can shape how authentic you feel — stand center-stage, breathe, and claim your space.• Courage can be quiet.

Malala Yousafzai refused to be silenced and fought for her right to an education. On Tuesday, October 9, 2012, when she was fifteen, she almost paid the ultimate price. She was shot in the head at point-blank range while riding the bus home from school, and few expected her to survive. Instead, Malala's miraculous recovery has taken her on an extraordinary journey from a remote valley in northern Pakistan to the halls of the United Nations in New York. At sixteen, she has become a global symbol of peaceful protest and the youngest nominee ever for the Nobel Peace Prize. I am Malala is the remarkable tale of a family uprooted by global terrorism, of the fight for girls' education, of a father who, himself a school owner, championed and encouraged his daughter to write and attend school, and of brave parents who have a fierce love for their daughter in a society that prizes sons. I am Malala will make you believe in the power of one person's voice to inspire change in the world. PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying reference material will be available in your My Library section along with the audio.  Critic Reviews: ""Narrator Archie Panjabi is an excellent choice to deliver this memoir of the Pakistani girl who stood up to the Taliban. Her voice is youthful, lilting, and buoyant, invoking the key qualities of the now well-known young woman who, at the age of 15, was shot three times in the face by the Taliban because she actively advocated education for girls. Panjabi narrates with vigor; rapid sentences and warm tones evoke Malala's persona. The listener has the feeling of being told this story by Malala herself rather than by an actor, which is the best type of audiobook. Those who want to hear more about Afghanistan, Pakistan's Swat Valley, or the family behind this courageous young person will not be disappointed.""

But with the encouragement of her father, an outspoken educator, Malala dared to challenge that idea—first through anonymous blog posts, then in public speeches that would make headlines around the world. Her message was simple but powerful: girls deserve an education.At just 15 years old, Malala was targeted by the Taliban for this belief and shot in the head on her way home from school. But what was meant to silence her only amplified her voice. Her survival became a symbol of resistance, and her advocacy gained global momentum.In this episode, we explore how Malala transformed tragedy into a global mission. Through narration, original soundscapes, and Malala’s own words, we follow her path from the narrow valleys of Mingora to the halls of the United Nations—and to the moment when, at 17, she became the youngest Nobel Peace Prize laureate in history.We also look beyond the headlines. What drives a teenager to risk her life for education? What does it mean to lead a movement when you’re still growing up yourself? And how does Malala continue to fight for the 130 million girls worldwide who are still denied access to education?This episode is a tribute to the power of youth, the courage of conviction, and the belief that education is not just a personal privilege but a global imperative.To learn more about the Malala Fund, visit Malala.org.Have thoughts on this episode?

A headline-grabbing development is her announcement of a worldwide book tour for her latest memoir *Finding My Way*, set to be published by Atria Books on October 21. The tour launches on publication day in New York and will sweep through major cities across the US, UK, and Canada, including London, Toronto, Chicago, Houston, and Los Angeles, offering fans a chance at not just readings but premium VIP meet and greets as well. According to Malala’s press statement picked up by Consequence, she calls this her “most personal” book yet, promising to share her coming-of-age story and spark genuine conversation with readers.Social media is already bubbling with excitement, as fans scramble for tickets and plenty are sharing pre-order confirmations and speculation about which additional cities might be announced. Meanwhile, ELLE reported that Malala closed the 40th Anniversary Elle Style Awards in London with a moving speech—she was honored as their Inspirational Icon and joked about adjusting the mic for her height with trademark humility and wit. Her closing remarks were nothing short of rousing: she openly pondered the daunting scale of global crises such as the loss of girls’ rights under the Taliban and devastation in Gaza, admitting to 'lying awake at night' out of empathy and concern.On the humanitarian front, the Malala Fund issued a press release detailing her and her father Ziauddin’s allocation of $230,000 in emergency relief grants for schools and children hit by catastrophic floods in Pakistan. Her father, recently touring the embattled Swat, Buner, and Shangla districts, called out for climate resilience and urgent international investment in education after witnessing heartbreaking destruction—displaced families, damaged schools, and children losing their futures.Internationally, Malala’s voice continues to cut through the noise of geopolitical conflict. At a major summit on girls’ education in Muslim nations, with dozens of governments in attendance and widely covered by Arab News, she condemned Israel’s destruction of Gaza’s education infrastructure, promising to continue calling out human rights violations and demanding action for Palestinian children. Her recent posts on X, formerly Twitter, addressed peace between India and Pakistan, urging both countries to step back from hostility and protect children from the fallout of rising tension.There is no indication of any negative developments, controversies, or speculative news involving Malala Yousafzai in the past several days. Her media presence remains that of a tireless Nobel Peace Prize-winning campaigner—mixing humanitarian sharpness, literary promise, and her distinctive blend of vulnerability and global authority—standing tall, literally and figuratively, even in her lighthearted remarks about microphones and short stature.Get the best deals https://amzn.to/3ODvOtaThis content was created in partnership and with the help of Artificial Intelligence AI",https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ES2XHD1K4eO6idTS2gIUn,2025-09-16,2AV6Hq6KWVvkf64rnVBhZt,Malala Yousafzai  - Audio Biography,Inception Point Ai,1761057415.8671477

When I almost died it was just after midday.' When the Taliban took control of the Swat Valley in Pakistan, one girl spoke out. Malala Yousafzai refused to be silenced and fought for her right to an education. On Tuesday, October 9, 2012, when she was fifteen, she almost paid the ultimate price. She was shot in the head at point-blank range while riding the bus home from school, and few expected her to survive. Instead, Malala's miraculous recovery has taken her on an extraordinary journey from a remote valley in northern Pakistan to the halls of the United Nations in New York. At sixteen, she became a global symbol of peaceful protest and the youngest nominee ever for the Nobel Peace Prize. I AM MALALA is the remarkable tale of a family uprooted by global terrorism, of the fight for girls' education, of a father who, himself a school owner, championed and encouraged his daughter to write and attend school, and of brave parents who have a fierce love for their daughter in a society that prizes sons.

Elle a appelé hier les dirigeants musulmans à ne pas donner de ""légitimité"" aux Talibans au pouvoir en Afghanistan. ""Pour le dire simplement, déclare Malala, les Talibans ne considèrent pas les femmes comme des êtres humains. La jeune femme les accuse de dissimuler – je cite à nouveau- ""leurs crimes sous couvert de justifications culturelles et religieuses"". Pour Malala, les dirigeants musulmans doivent aujourd’hui élever leurs voix, utiliser leur pouvoir et montrer une vraie autoritéC’est ce que la jeune femme a dénoncé devant des représentants de dizaines de pays musulmans. Il faut le rappeler : L'Afghanistan est, depuis le retour au pouvoir des Taliban en 2021, le seul pays au monde où les filles et les femmes n'ont pas le droit d'aller à l'école secondaire ou à l'université. Il faut savoir aussi que le gouvernement taliban a été convié à ce sommet sur l'éducation mais aucun responsable ne s'est déplacé. L'ONU dénonce un ""apartheid de genre"" imposé par les Talibans depuis leur retour aux commandes. C’est quoi le but de ce sommet sur l’éducation des filles Ann-Lo ? Son objectif principal, c’est de confirmer l’engagement de la communauté musulmane à rendre les filles autonomes par l’éducation. On le disait, et les chiffres sont tristement éloquents : des dizaines de millions de filles ne sont pas scolarisées dans les pays à majorité musulmane, notamment au Bangladesh et au Nigeria.Revenons un peu en arrière pour mieux comprendre son parcours… En 2012, Malala Yousafzai est attaquée par des Taliban pakistanais L’attaque a lieu dans un bus scolaire près de la frontière avec l'Afghanistan. Malala est victime d'une tentative d'assassinat à la sortie de son école. Le tireur tire trois fois : le premier tir atteint Malala au visage ; les deux autres tirs atteignent d'autres écolières. Très grièvement blessée au cou et à la tête, Malala est transférée à l'hôpital par hélicoptère de l'armée. Après 5h d’opération, les chirurgiens parviennent à retirer la balle qui a traversé son crâne et son cou. Elle reste inconsciente longtemps avant d’être transférée vers l’hôpital de Birmingham au Royaume-Uni. S’en suit un long chemin vers la guérison… et une rééducation à domicile.Depuis cette attaque, il y a 12 ans, la militante n'est revenue que de rares fois au Pakistan depuis son évacuation vers le Royaume-UniLe Royaume-Uni, où elle vit aujourd’hui et où elle est devenue une porte-parole mondiale en faveur de l'éducation des filles. À partir de 2013, Malala intervient dans plusieurs régions du monde pour transmettre ses messages. Elle rencontre notamment la reine Élisabeth II et Barack Obama. En 2014, elle est devenue la plus jeune lauréate du prix Nobel de la paix, à seulement 17 ans !

He was the most prominent black scientist of the early 20th century. While a professor at Tuskegee Institute, Carver developed techniques to improve soils depleted by repeated plantings of cotton. He wanted poor farmers to grow other crops, such as peanuts and sweet potatoes, as a source of their own food and to improve their quality of life. The most popular of his 44 practical bulletins for farmers contained 105 food recipes using peanuts. Although he spent years developing and promoting numerous products made from peanuts, none became commercially successful. Malala Yousafzai, often referred to mononymously as Malala, is a Pakistani activist for female education and the youngest Nobel Prize laureate. She is known for human rights advocacy, especially the education of women and children in her native Swat Valley in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, northwest Pakistan, where the local Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan had at times banned girls from attending school.

Malala Yousafzai,"""Malala Yousafzai""",2uufLQ1k4u3iS29nrABJAW,S01E04 Persönlichkeiten - Malala Yousafzai,"Über wen sprechen wir? Heute sprechen wir über Malala Yousafzai, sie ist eine bekannte Frau aus Pakistan. Wer ist Malala Yousafzai? Malala Yousafzai wurde am 12. Juli 1997 im Swat-Tal in Pakistan geboren. Sie hat zwei Brüder. Sie heissen Khushal und Atal. Malala wurde nach der Afghanischen Poetin und Volksheldin Malalai von Maiwand benannt. Ihr Name bedeutet ,,kummervoll’’. Der Nachname Yousafzai ist im Swat Tal verbreitet und zeigt, dass sie dem Stamm der Yousaf angehört. Dieser Stammesname ist eine Variante aus Paschtu und Urdu, dem beiden Sprachen an der Grenze zwischen Afghanistan und Pakistan. Im Arabischen ist der Namen Yusuf und bedeutet Josef. Die Endung -zai ist für die einzelnen paschtunischen Sippen sowohl in Afghanistan als auch in Pakistan typisch. Warum ist sie bekannt? Sie ist bekannt für ihren Kampf gegen die Unterdrückung von Kindern und jungen Menschen sowie ihren Kampf für das Recht auf Bildung für alle Kinder. Was ist mit Malala Yousafzai passiert? Malala ist etwas Schreckliches passiert. Sie wurde in einem Schulbus von einem Mann angeschossen. Warum wurde Malala in den Kopf geschossen? Das passierte, weil Malala für die Rechte von Mädchen in Pakistan kämpfte. Sie wollte, dass alle Mädchen zur Schule gehen dürfen. Damit hat sie die Taliban sehr verärgert. Malala überlebte den Tötungsversuch mit schweren Verletzungen am Kopf. Malala wurde in einem Krankenhaus in Pakistan operiert. Danach konnte sie nach Großbritannien reisen, wo sich weitere Ärzte um sie kümmerten. Die ganze Welt wurde auf Malala und ihre Geschichte aufmerksam. Sie bekam viel Unterstützung von allen Ländern. Malala schrieb danach ein Buch über ihre Geschichte. Wie heisst das Buch und wann hat sie es geschrieben? Ihr Buch heisst «Ich bin Malala. Das Mädchen, das die Taliban erschiessen wollen, weil es für das Recht auf Bildung kämpft» und sie hat es im Herbst 2013 geschrieben. Dieses Buch wurde in viele Sprachen übersetzt und in vielen Ländern gelesen. Was wollte sie verändern? Die meisten Menschen erinnern sich sehr gut an die Erschießung von Malala Yousafzai im Jahr 2012. In allen Ländern haben die Nachrichten von diesem Attentat berichtet. Malala setzte sich in Pakistan für das Recht auf Bildung für junge Mädchen ein. In Pakistan dürfen Mädchen wegen den Konflikten durch die Taliban nicht in die Schule gehen. Malala wollte das nicht akzeptieren. Sie fand das unfair und hat sich dagegen gewehrt. Durch ihren Mut hat Malala und ihre Foundation sehr grosse Fortschritte weltweit erzielt, um sicherzustellen, dass kleine Kinder und vor allem Mädchen die Schule besuchen können. Die Stiftung hat viele Projekte veröffentlicht, um zu zeigen, dass es noch immer grosse Probleme und Ungleichheit bei der Schulbildung von Jugendlichen weltweit gibt. Was hat sie gewonnen? Im Jahr 2013 war Malala die jüngste Person, der jemals der «Sacharow-Preis» verliehen worden war. In der Rede sprach sie sich für das Recht eines jeden Kindes auf Bildung aus und widmete den Preis den «unbesungenen Helden Pakistans». 2014 erhielt Malala Yousafzai gemeinsam mit Kailash Satyarthi den Friedensnobelpreis „für ihren Kampf gegen die Unterdrückung von Kindern und jungen Menschen sowie ihren Kampf für das Recht auf Bildung für alle Kinder"". Sie ist somit sowohl die jüngste Trägerin des Sacharow-Preises als auch des Friedensnobelpreises. Warum sollte sie ein Vorbild für uns sein? Wir müssen wie Malala für die Rechte von uns und anderen kämpfen. Ungleichheit und Ungerechtigkeit wird in vielen Ländern immer grösser. Deshalb müssen alle Menschen versuchen, gerecht zu sein und wie Malala für die Menschenrechte kämpfen. Wir können alle etwas tun, damit die Welt besser wird. Malala zeigt es. Sie kämpft ihr ganzes Leben für die Rechte von Mädchen.",https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uufLQ1k4u3iS29nrABJAW,2023-03-20,5thxGFKBwfluKWSbx5tjsW,rheinspringen im Ohr,rheinspringen,1761057420.2505515

Malala Yousafzai,"""Malala Yousafzai""",3WKI2eOHlS5z4crRh0j4vG,#85- Malala Yousafzai  from Radiotalk,"@ UN Youth Assembly (2013)  I speak not for myself, but for those without a voice can be heard.  Those who have fought for their rights. Their right to live in peace. Their right to be treated with dignity. Their right to equality of opportunity. Their right to be educated.   Dear friends, on 9 October 2012, the Taliban shot me on the left side of my forehead. They shot my friends, too. They thought that the bullets would silence us, but they failed. And out of that silence came thousands of voices. The terrorists thought they would change my aims and stop my ambitions.   But nothing changed in my life except this: weakness, fear and hopelessness died. Strength, power and courage was born. I am the same Malala. My ambitions are the same. My hopes are the same.

I Am Malala. This is my story.    Malala Yousafzai was only ten years old when the Taliban took control of her region. They said music was a crime. They said women weren't allowed to go to the market. They said girls couldn't go to school.   Raised in a once-peaceful area of Pakistan transformed by terrorism, Malala was taught to stand up for what she believes. So she fought for her right to be educated. And on October 9, 2012, she nearly lost her life for the cause: She was shot point-blank while riding the bus on her way home from school.   No one expected her to survive.   Now Malala is an international symbol of peaceful protest and the youngest ever Nobel Peace Prize winner. In this Young Readers Edition of her bestselling memoir, which has been reimagined specifically for a younger audience and includes exclusive photos and material, we hear firsthand the remarkable story of a girl who knew from a young age that she wanted to change the world -- and did.   Malala's powerful story will open your eyes to another world and will make you believe in hope, truth, miracles and the possibility that one person -- one young person -- can inspire change in her community and beyond.",https://open.spotify.com/episode/1a938nwvtrBjU8JOjNgqqS,2014-08-19,5Cy45u5jfpKCTYaNlBNsCR,"Listen to Best Full Audiobooks in Kids, Non-fiction",thebookvoice.com,1761057421.281989

Malala Yousafzai refused to be silenced and fought for her right to an education.On Tuesday, October 9, 2012, when she was fifteen, she almost paid the ultimate price. She was shot in the head at point-blank range while riding the bus home from school, and few expected her to survive.Instead, Malala's miraculous recovery has taken her on an extraordinary journey from a remote valley in northern Pakistan to the halls of the United Nations in New York. At sixteen, she has become a global symbol of peaceful protest and the youngest nominee ever for the Nobel Peace Prize.I am Malala is the remarkable tale of a family uprooted by global terrorism, of the fight for girls' education, of a father who, himself a school owner, championed and encouraged his daughter to write and attend school, and of brave parents who have a fierce love for their daughter in a society that prizes sons.I am Malala will make you ",https://open.spotify.com/episode/5976JdzuQ5d2wQLVnSI0At,2024-01-13,6PFfQ4KxMbHIHltQzbJFzb,Download Book Or Read Book,Wakuni Shingen,1761057421.3245943

When her identity was discovered, Malala began to appear in both Pakistani and international media, advocating the freedom to pursue education for all. In October 2012, gunmen boarded Malala's school bus and shot her in the face, a bullet passing through her head and into her shoulder. Remarkably, Malala survived the shooting. At a very young age, Malala Yousafzai has become a worldwide symbol of courage and hope. Her shooting has sparked a wave of solidarity across Pakistan, not to mention globally, for the right to education, freedom from terror and female emancipation.

After her father was murdered, María escaped in the middle of the night with her mother. Zaynab was out of school for two years as she fled war before landing in America. Her sister, Sabreen, survived a harrowing journey to Italy. Ajida escaped horrific violence, but then found herself battling the elements to keep her family safe. Malala's experiences visiting refugee camps caused her to reconsider her own displacement — first as an Internally Displaced Person when she was a young child in Pakistan, and then as an international activist who could travel anywhere in the world except to the home she loved. In We Are Displaced, Malala not only explores her own story, but she also shares the personal stories of some of the incredible girls she has met on her journeys — girls who have lost their community, relatives, and often the only world they've ever known.  In a time of immigration crises, war, and border conflicts, We Are Displaced is an important reminder from one of the world's most prominent young activists that every single one of the 68.5 million currently displaced is a person — often a young person — with hopes and dreams.

Malala Yousafzai refused to be silenced and fought for her right to an education.On Tuesday, October 9, 2012, when she was fifteen, she almost paid the ultimate price. She was shot in the head at point-blank range while riding the bus home from school, and few expected her to survive.Instead, Malala's miraculous recovery has taken her on an extraordinary journey from a remote valley in northern Pakistan to the halls of the United Nations in New York. At sixteen, she has become a global symbol of peaceful protest and the youngest nominee ever for the Nobel Peace Prize.I am Malala is the remarkable tale of a family uprooted by global terrorism, of the fight for girls' education, of a father who, himself a school owner, championed and encouraged his daughter to write and attend school, and of brave parents who have a fierce love for their daughter in a society that prizes sons.I am Malala will make you ,. Supporting format: PDF, EPUB, Kindle, Audio, MOBI, HTML, RTF, TXT, etc.Supporting : PC, Android, Apple, Ipad, Iphone, etc.================ ** ================",https://open.spotify.com/episode/2SVdvhRJEZjlEP2UoGIjXV,2023-12-16,66swebRZ7O7nZi9KG97JAn,downloadthereadbook,Sando Kensaku,1761057422.3484633

Malala Yousafzai was born and raised in northwest Pakistan where the Taliban forbade girls like her from the basic human right of an education. An activist from a young age, she spoke up against the oppression of her people. In fact, she became such a voice for change that consequently she was shot by the Taliban at the age of 14 for speaking up for what is right and seeking change for her nation. Malala was forced to leave her childhood home and settle in Europe but, even after her near-death experience, she never stopped her activism. In fact, she went on to become the youngest person to ever win a Nobel Prize. Yousafzai's life is an inspirational story of overcoming the dangers and oppression of a tyrannical regime and of the power of both the spoken and written word to influence the lives of others. See the impact of this brilliant young woman's activism and how she became the inspiring young woman that she is today.",https://open.spotify.com/episode/1mwqVjdifw2KJD8FnnuUv3,2017-09-27,71HZD4kaOi3KJJYhw8C7LX,"Free Audiobooks That Feed Our Thoughts of Bios & Memoirs, Political Figures",Stream Free Audiobook,1761057422.4112191

Rockefeller Narrator: Jim Cassidy Format: Unabridged Length: 21 mins Language: English Release date: 03-30-16 Publisher: J.D. Rockefeller Ratings: 5 of 5 out of 1 votes Genres: Bios & Memoirs, Political Figures  Publisher's Summary: In October 2012, a 15-year-old girl from the Swat Valley in North-western Pakistan was shot by the Taliban. Seriously wounded with three shots fired at her, with one bullet entering and exiting her head, she was airlifted and brought to the intensive care unit of a hospital in Birmingham, England. After months of treatments and surgeries, she was back to attending school in Birmingham. This 15-year-old girl was Malala Yousafzai, who soon became an inspiration for her exemplary courage in fighting for her rights against the Taliban and surviving a near-death attempt on her life. Soon, in 2014, she became the youngest person to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Who is Malala Yousafzai? Why was the Taliban so scared of a 15-year-old girl that they attempted to kill her? What great humanitarian work was she doing that she won the Nobel Peace Prize at such a young age? Continue listening and you will soon find out everything about this inspirational girl from Pakistan.",https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SNrAwql2pz2TZdy5LcKvs,2016-03-30,2FS8Dg6F0Mfhfee6c1KWzl,"Listen Legally to Best Full Audiobooks in Bios & Memoirs, Political Figures",Online Free Audiobooks,1761057423.435387

Malala Yousafzai refused to be silenced and fought for her right to an education.On Tuesday, October 9, 2012, when she was fifteen, she almost paid the ultimate price. She was shot in the head at point-blank range while riding the bus home from school, and few expected her to survive.Instead, Malala's miraculous recovery has taken her on an extraordinary journey from a remote valley in northern Pakistan to the halls of the United Nations in New York. At sixteen, she has become a global symbol of peaceful protest and the youngest nominee ever for the Nobel Peace Prize.I am Malala is the remarkable tale of a family uprooted by global terrorism, of the fight for girls' education, of a father who, himself a school owner, championed and encouraged his daughter to write and attend school, and of brave parents who have a fierce love for their daughter in a society that prizes sons.I am Malala will make you ",https://open.spotify.com/episode/1EC3iFq78kb6W8pIBprvvA,2023-12-24,7MowL3DUr05C7nr3cd1Yq4,Download OR Read Book,Kimura Ukyo,1761057423.5000787

When I almost died it was just after midday.' When the Taliban took control of the Swat Valley in Pakistan, one girl spoke out. Malala Yousafzai refused to be silenced and fought for her right to an education. On Tuesday, October 9, 2012, when she was fifteen, she almost paid the ultimate price. She was shot in the head at point-blank range while riding the bus home from school, and few expected her to survive. Instead, Malala's miraculous recovery has taken her on an extraordinary journey from a remote valley in northern Pakistan to the halls of the United Nations in New York. At sixteen, she became a global symbol of peaceful protest and the youngest nominee ever for the Nobel Peace Prize. I AM MALALA is the remarkable tale of a family uprooted by global terrorism, of the fight for girls' education, of a father who, himself a school owner, championed and encouraged his daughter to write and attend school, and of brave parents who have a fierce love for their daughter in a society that prizes sons.

Lorsque les talibans ont pris le contrôle de la vallée du Swat, au Pakistan, une toute jeune fille a élevé la voix. Refusant l'ignorance à laquelle la condamnait le fanatisme, Malala Yousafzai résolut de se battre pour continuer d'aller à l'école. Son courage faillit lui coûter la vie. Le 9 octobre 2012, alors qu'elle n'avait que quinze ans, elle fut grièvement blessée par un taliban dans un car scolaire. Cet attentat censé la faire taire n'a que renforcé sa conviction dans son combat.   Malala Yousafzai est la nouvelle incarnation mondiale de la protestation pacifique. Moi, Malala est le récit bouleversant d'une famille exilée à cause du terrorisme ; de parents courageux qui, dans une société où les garçons sont rois, ont manifesté un amour immense à leur fille et l'ont encouragée à s'instruire, à écrire, à dénoncer l'insoutenable et à exiger, pour toutes et tous, l'accès au savoir. ©2013 Salarzai Limited / Calmann-Lévy.

When her identity was discovered, Malala began to appear in both Pakistani and international media, advocating the freedom to pursue education for all. In October 2012, gunmen boarded Malala's school bus and shot her in the face, a bullet passing through her head and into her shoulder. Remarkably, Malala survived the shooting. At a very young age, Malala Yousafzai has become a worldwide symbol of courage and hope. Her shooting has sparked a wave of solidarity across Pakistan, not to mention globally, for the right to education, freedom from terror and female emancipation. I Am Malala, the memoir of Malala Yousafzai, will shed insight into the lives of those children who cannot attend school, will tell the inspiring story of a schoolgirl faced the Taliban with courage and bravery. Read by Archie Panjabi, with a prologue read by Malala Yousafzai.  Critic Reviews: ""Narrator Archie Panjabi is an excellent choice to deliver this memoir of the Pakistani girl who stood up to the Taliban. Her voice is youthful, lilting, and buoyant, invoking the key qualities of the now well-known young woman who, at the age of 15, was shot three times in the face by the Taliban because she actively advocated education for girls. Panjabi narrates with vigor; rapid sentences and warm tones evoke Malala's persona. The listener has the feeling of being told this story by Malala herself rather than by an actor, which is the best type of audiobook. Those who want to hear more about Afghanistan, Pakistan's Swat Valley, or the family behind this courageous young person will not be disappointed.""

Lorsque les talibans ont pris le contrôle de la vallée du Swat, au Pakistan, une toute jeune fille a élevé la voix.

Le 9 octobre 2012, alors qu'elle n'avait que quinze ans, elle fut grièvement blessée par un taliban dans un car scolaire. Cet attentat censé la faire taire n'a que renforcé sa conviction dans son combat.   Malala Yousafzai est la nouvelle incarnation mondiale de la protestation pacifique.

After her father was murdered, María escaped in the middle of the night with her mother. Zaynab was out of school for two years as she fled war before landing in America. Her sister, Sabreen, survived a harrowing journey to Italy. Ajida escaped horrific violence, but then found herself battling the elements to keep her family safe. Malala's experiences visiting refugee camps caused her to reconsider her own displacement — first as an Internally Displaced Person when she was a young child in Pakistan, and then as an international activist who could travel anywhere in the world except to the home she loved. In We Are Displaced, Malala not only explores her own story, but she also shares the personal stories of some of the incredible girls she has met on her journeys — girls who have lost their community, relatives, and often the only world they've ever known.  In a time of immigration crises, war, and border conflicts, We Are Displaced is an important reminder from one of the world's most prominent young activists that every single one of the 68.5 million currently displaced is a person — often a young person — with hopes and dreams.

Malala Yousafzai refused to be silenced and fought for her right to an education. On Tuesday, October 9, 2012, when she was fifteen, she almost paid the ultimate price. She was shot in the head at point-blank range while riding the bus home from school, and few expected her to survive.

At sixteen, she has become a global symbol of peaceful protest and the youngest nominee ever for the Nobel Peace Prize. I am Malala is the remarkable tale of a family uprooted by global terrorism, of the fight for girls' education, of a father who, himself a school owner, championed and encouraged his daughter to write and attend school, and of brave parents who have a fierce love for their daughter in a society that prizes sons.

I Am Malala. This is my story.    Malala Yousafzai was only ten years old when the Taliban took control of her region. They said music was a crime. They said women weren't allowed to go to the market. They said girls couldn't go to school.   Raised in a once-peaceful area of Pakistan transformed by terrorism, Malala was taught to stand up for what she believes. So she fought for her right to be educated. And on October 9, 2012, she nearly lost her life for the cause: She was shot point-blank while riding the bus on her way home from school.   No one expected her to survive.   Now Malala is an international symbol of peaceful protest and the youngest ever Nobel Peace Prize winner. In this Young Readers Edition of her bestselling memoir, which has been reimagined specifically for a younger audience and includes exclusive photos and material, we hear firsthand the remarkable story of a girl who knew from a young age that she wanted to change the world -- and did.   Malala's powerful story will open your eyes to another world and will make you believe in hope, truth, miracles and the possibility that one person -- one young person -- can inspire change in her community and beyond.",https://open.spotify.com/episode/0D52cA2cGWoj8eIYEMQGXa,2014-08-19,4mqfSco2my1nwhVBJQ9dGR,Embark On A Full Audiobook That Is Simply Next-Level.,thebookvoice.com,1761057426.5517268

Title: We Are Displaced: My Journey and Stories from Refugee Girls Around the World Author: Malala Yousafzai Narrator: Malala Yousafzai, Neela Vaswani Format: Unabridged Audiobook Length: 4 hours 1 minute Release date: January  8, 2019 Ratings: Ratings of Book: 5 of Total 2 Genres: Tough Topics Publisher's Summary:      In this powerful book, Nobel Peace Prize winner and New York Times bestselling author Malala Yousafzai introduces the people behind the statistics and news stories about the millions of people displaced worldwide. After her father was murdered, María escaped in the middle of the night with her mother. Zaynab was out of school for two years as she fled war before landing in America. Her sister, Sabreen, survived a harrowing journey to Italy. Ajida escaped horrific violence, but then found herself battling the elements to keep her family safe. Malala's experiences visiting refugee camps caused her to reconsider her own displacement — first as an Internally Displaced Person when she was a young child in Pakistan, and then as an international activist who could travel anywhere in the world except to the home she loved. In We Are Displaced, Malala not only explores her own story, but she also shares the personal stories of some of the incredible girls she has met on her journeys — girls who have lost their community, relatives, and often the only world they've ever known.  In a time of immigration crises, war, and border conflicts, We Are Displaced is an important reminder from one of the world's most prominent young activists that every single one of the 68.5 million currently displaced is a person — often a young person — with hopes and dreams.

Title: I Am Malala: The Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban Author: Malala Yousafzai Narrator: Archie Panjabi Format: Unabridged Audiobook Length: 10 hours 0 minutes Release date: October  8, 2013 Ratings: Ratings of Book: 4.18 of Total 220   Ratings of Narrator: 4.53 of Total 36 Genres: Memoirs Publisher's Summary:  A MEMOIR BY THE YOUNGEST RECIPIENT OF THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE  As seen on Netflix with David Letterman 'I come from a country that was created at midnight. When I almost died it was just after midday.' When the Taliban took control of the Swat Valley in Pakistan, one girl spoke out. Malala Yousafzai refused to be silenced and fought for her right to an education. On Tuesday, October 9, 2012, when she was fifteen, she almost paid the ultimate price. She was shot in the head at point-blank range while riding the bus home from school, and few expected her to survive. Instead, Malala's miraculous recovery has taken her on an extraordinary journey from a remote valley in northern Pakistan to the halls of the United Nations in New York. At sixteen, she became a global symbol of peaceful protest and the youngest nominee ever for the Nobel Peace Prize. I AM MALALA is the remarkable tale of a family uprooted by global terrorism, of the fight for girls' education, of a father who, himself a school owner, championed and encouraged his daughter to write and attend school, and of brave parents who have a fierce love for their daughter in a society that prizes sons. I AM MALALA will make you believe in the power of one person's voice to inspire change in the world.",https://open.spotify.com/episode/48Fv2AHWYHEbYXvvEYJ635,2013-10-08,2HKVU7yaVhsw1ifinM6wAT,"Listen to Audiobooks in Biography & Memoir, Memoirs",Gage  Glover,1761057426.65149

Her journey, one marked by resilience and unwavering determination, has etched her name indelibly in the annals of history, forever inspiring generations to come. Born on July 12, 1997, in Mingora, Pakistan, Malala was raised in a household that cherished education. Her father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, was a passionate educator who ran a school for girls, instilling in Malala a deep-rooted love for learning. From an early age, Malala displayed an insatiable curiosity, her mind brimming with questions and a yearning to explore the vast expanse of knowledge. As Malala grew, she witnessed firsthand the oppressive rule of the Taliban, an extremist group that sought to impose strict control over the Swat Valley. Their tyrannical regime brought forth a wave of restrictions, including the banning of girls' education. Malala's heart ached for her fellow young women, denied the fundamental right to learn and pursue their dreams. Undeterred by the Taliban's threats and intimidation, Malala refused to be silenced. At the tender age of 11, she began writing a blog for the BBC Urdu service, using the pseudonym 'Gul Makai' to protect her identity. In her blog posts, Malala chronicled her daily life under Taliban rule, eloquently voicing her aspirations for a world where all girls had access to education.",https://open.spotify.com/episode/4V2g9o59SzD1xlfslQuybk,2023-04-25,6z7Qgxbq5rlrIoCaQTfspZ,"Streaming Supply of Full Audiobooks in Science & Technology, Computers",Free Audiobooks,1761057426.68624

When I almost died it was just after midday. We’d finished for the day and I was on the open-back truck we use as a school bus. There were no windows, just thick plastic sheeting that flapped at the sides and a postage stamp of open sky at the back through which I caught a glimpse of a kite wheeling up and down. It was pink, my favourite colour.’In 2009 Malala Yousafzai began writing an anonymous blog for BBC Urdu about life in the Swat Valley as the Taliban gained control, at times banning girls from attending school. When her identity was discovered, Malala began to appear in Pakistani and international media, campaigning for education for all. On 9 October 2012, Malala was shot at point-blank range by a member of the Taliban on the way home from  Inside the Book: Reading I Am Malala: The Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban Download I Am Malala: The Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban PDF/Epub I Am Malala: The Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban .

After her father was murdered, María escaped in the middle of the night with her mother. Zaynab was out of school for two years as she fled war before landing in America. Her sister, Sabreen, survived a harrowing journey to Italy. Ajida escaped horrific violence, but then found herself battling the elements to keep her family safe. Malala's experiences visiting refugee camps caused her to reconsider her own displacement — first as an Internally Displaced Person when she was a young child in Pakistan, and then as an international activist who could travel anywhere in the world except to the home she loved. In We Are Displaced, Malala not only explores her own story, but she also shares the personal stories of some of the incredible girls she has met on her journeys — girls who have lost their community, relatives, and often the only world they've ever known.  In a time of immigration crises, war, and border conflicts, We Are Displaced is an important reminder from one of the world's most prominent young activists that every single one of the 68.5 million currently displaced is a person — often a young person — with hopes and dreams.

Malala Yousafzai,"""Malala Yousafzai""",2gBxtDXQc7Kp6qcqXubpuv,Grateful on Purpose,"Malala Yousafzai is a Pakistani activist working for education and women. In 2005, while riding on a bus, she was shot in the head by a member of the Taliban, and the attack was revenge for her activism. Incredibly, Malala recovered from her gruesome injury and today considers herself an ambassador of gratefulness. Here’s a quote: “I can speak. I can see you, I can see everyone, and today I can speak and I’m getting better day by day, it’s just because of the prayers of the people and because of these prayers, God has given me this new life, and this is a second life. This is a new life, and I want to serve the people.” Nick Vujicic is another person who has decided that his physical circumstances will not keep him from a life of joy. Born without limbs, yes—without arms or legs, Nick leads a full life, including marriage and children. A motivational speaker known worldwide, Nick always has a smile on his face—and he says this about gratitude, “If you keep concentrating on the things you wish you had over the things you have, you sort of forget the things that you have, so be grateful for what it is that you already have.” Nick also tells audiences to be thankful for three things most important in their lives. This calls to mind Hebrews 12:28, which says, “Therefore, let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken and thus let us offer to God acceptable worship with reverence and awe.” For believers, this is a beautiful reminder that we are part of a family of believers that will live with God forever. This is the greatest gift we’ve been given, and it should motivate us not only to be grateful for ourselves, but to share the Good News of Jesus Christ with others. By purposing to be a grateful person day in and day out, you will shine a light on the love of Christ for those that you come in contact with. And that is an ambassadorship with eternal implications. Let’s pray. Father God, we want to be Your ambassadors here on earth. Many are looking for life changed by the power of Your Gospel. Help us to make this a priority. In Jesus’ name, amen.Change your shirt, and you can change the world!

I'm your host, Sarah, and today we're diving into the inspiring journey of Malala Yousafzai.Picture this: a young girl in Pakistan's Swat Valley, defying the Taliban's ban on female education. That's where Malala's story begins. At just 11 years old, she started blogging anonymously for the BBC about life under Taliban rule. Her words sparked a movement, but they also made her a target.In 2012, a Taliban gunman shot Malala in the head as she rode the bus to school. Many thought she wouldn't survive, but Malala's resilience proved them wrong. Not only did she recover, but she emerged stronger and more determined than ever.I remember watching the news as Malala addressed the United Nations on her 16th birthday. Her words still give me chills: ""One child, one teacher, one book, and one pen can change the world."" It wasn't just what she said, but how she said it - with unwavering conviction and hope.Malala's fight for education didn't stop there. She founded the Malala Fund, advocating for girls' education worldwide. In 2014, at just 17, she became the youngest Nobel Peace Prize laureate. But what strikes me most about Malala is her humility. Despite global recognition, she remains focused on her mission.I had the privilege of attending one of Malala's speeches last year. The auditorium was packed, but you could hear a pin drop as she spoke. She shared stories of girls she'd met - in refugee camps, in remote villages - all hungry for knowledge. ""Education is not a privilege,"" she said. ""It's a basic human right.""Malala's journey reminds us that one voice can ignite change. She faced death threats, exile, and a long recovery, yet she never wavered in her belief that every girl deserves an education. Her resilience in the face of adversity is truly awe-inspiring.As I reflect on Malala's story, I'm reminded of the power we all have to make a difference. We may not all face gunmen or address the UN, but we can all stand up for what we believe in. Malala's resilience challenges us to be braver, to speak louder, and to fight harder for equality.So, dear listeners, I leave you with this question: What change will you champion today? Remember, as Malala taught us, even the smallest act of courage can ripple out and transform the world.For more http://www.quietplease.aiGet the best deals https://amzn.to/3ODvOtaThis content was created in partnership and with the help of Artificial Intelligence AI",https://open.spotify.com/episode/0aZ6L86u807OVxz5O633lr,2025-03-09,3d8HQOLOtftJKtfosRkxED,Women's Stories,Inception Point Ai,1761057428.7326896

The world held its breath as she fought for her life.But Malala's story doesn't end there. In fact, it was just the beginning. After months of surgeries and rehabilitation, she not only survived but emerged stronger than ever. Malala's near-death experience only fueled her determination to fight for education.In 2014, at just 17 years old, Malala became the youngest person ever to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.

Malala Yousafzai,"""Malala Yousafzai""",0neG4jUtiFaPXpYrBnr6C7,Malala's Powerful Return: Championing Education and Peace,"Malai Yousafzai BioSnap a weekly updated Biography.Malala Yousafzai has commanded headlines and social media cycles over the past few days with her high-profile return to Pakistan, where she was, in her own words shared with AFP, truly honored, overwhelmed, and happy to be back after years away. Her visit was anchored by her prominent role at a global summit on girls’ education in the Islamic world, hosted in Islamabad. According to Asharq Al-Awsat, Malala told reporters she would use her address to urge Muslim leaders to hold the Taliban accountable for their ongoing denial of education to Afghan women and girls and to champion girls’ rights worldwide—issues she echoed in her public posts on X. She underscored how urgent the situation is, emphasizing that Afghanistan remains the only country in the world where girls and women are banned from attending school or university. Her return to Pakistan, where over 26 million children remain out of school mostly due to poverty, was branded as symbolically important and biographically poignant, given her history as a survivor of Taliban violence in her native Swat Valley and her global crusade for education rights.Apart from her diplomatic push, Malala weighed in on South Asian geopolitics this week, appealing publicly on X and via The Business Standard for India and Pakistan to deescalate tensions, warning that hatred and violence are the real enemies and urging leaders to prioritize dialogue and civilian safety. Her intervention was widely circulated by international media, marking her as a significant voice in regional peace advocacy.In an exclusive Vatican News interview, Malala detailed her continued commitment to girls’ education and reflected on the role of education in driving gender equality and peace, citing her father's grassroots activism as an enduring inspiration. She highlighted startling statistics and called on world leaders for urgent action, reiterating her global message that education is a fundamental right.While official news focused mainly on Malala’s direct work, her family has also maintained public engagement. Local Pakistani outlets including The Nation reported that her parents, Ziauddin and Toor Pekai Yousafzai, visited flood-hit areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, meeting with survivors and educators. This personal touch underscores Malala’s ongoing connection to her homeland and the daily realities it faces.Looking ahead, Malala is set for a major public appearance in London at the Southbank Centre in November, where she will discuss her new memoir, “Finding My Way,” promising to share stories of mental health, identity, and self-discovery, offering attendees signed copies and a candid conversation that will go beyond her public persona, according to event organizers.There is no indication of controversy, scandal, or unconfirmed reports around Malala in this news cycle. Major headlines celebrate her Islamabad summit appearance and her peace plea, confirming that Malala remains a globally recognized leader and a biographically significant voice for education and peace.Get the best deals https://amzn.to/3ODvOtaThis content was created in partnership and with the help of Artificial Intelligence AI",https://open.spotify.com/episode/0neG4jUtiFaPXpYrBnr6C7,2025-09-09,2AV6Hq6KWVvkf64rnVBhZt,Malala Yousafzai  - Audio Biography,Inception Point Ai,1761057428.7421587
Malala Yousafzai,"""Malala Yousafzai""",1QABh99yNhlZOfgqSPqDDG,Malala's Emotional Homecoming: Advocating for Change,"Malai Yousafzai BioSnap a weekly updated Biography.The past few days have been anything but quiet for Malala Yousafzai. On August 6, Arab News reports that Malala made an emotional return to her hometown in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Shangla district, revisiting for the first time since surviving the 2012 Taliban shooting. Security was tight and locals barely knew of her visit which included heartfelt moments with family, time spent beside the river, and prayers for peace across Pakistan. She visited ancestral sites and projects funded by the Malala Fund, underscoring her commitment to girls’ education even in regions marked by violence. On social media, Malala shared warm reflections on her journey, describing her “joy” at reconnecting with her roots. Headlines everywhere highlighted the significance of this trip, given that she had not seen this hometown in thirteen years.Earlier this week, Malala’s diplomatic and activist profile remained high. The TBS News carried her powerful address at Islamabad’s summit on girls’ education, where she called on Muslim leaders not to “legitimise” the Afghan Taliban government and demanded they “raise their voices” to protect women’s rights. “Simply put, the Taliban do not see women as human beings,” she declared, pushing the boundaries of political conversation on the treatment of women under Taliban rule. This summit, backed by the Muslim World League, saw Malala reinforcing her position as an uncompromising voice for girls’ education.The social and political buzz didn’t stop there. National Herald India reported her appeal to the United Nations to help Kashmiri children return to school, an effort that may signal her intent to widen her advocacy efforts in the restive region. On August 8, AOL covered Malala’s public reaffirmation of her support for Palestinian rights after some online backlash over a rumored collaboration with a former US secretary. Rather than retreat, she made her stance clear, confirming her solidarity with Palestinians at a time when public figures increasingly take sides.Instagram remains a platform where Malala weaves personal and professional narratives. Photos from July and posts earlier this month include messages about mental health and resilience, notably “You can’t be who you wish to be... until you start and restart,” reflecting her signature optimism and openness. There was also a viral moment when a fan posted about meeting Malala, calling her “a global symbol of courage and education.”Beyond headlines, SBISiali’s August 7 feature painted Malala as “a bullet that didn’t silence her but made her a global icon,” echoing the long-term significance of her career and impact. At grassroots levels and through events like Book Buddies and comments at Oxford University, her influence on young leaders and the literacy movement is repeatedly recognized.Speculation persists about her next steps in global advocacy—particularly following the heightened attention from her Pakistan visit, increased engagement on Kashmiri and Palestinian issues, and the ongoing summit diplomacy in Islamabad. For now, the world is watching as Malala continues to reinvigorate her roots, shape debates, and set new benchmarks for activism.Get the best deals https://amzn.to/3ODvOtaThis content was created in partnership and with the help of Artificial Intelligence AI",https://open.spotify.com/episode/1QABh99yNhlZOfgqSPqDDG,2025-08-09,2AV6Hq6KWVvkf64rnVBhZt,Malala Yousafzai  - Audio Biography,Inception Point Ai,1761057428.7476635
Malala Yousafzai,"""Malala Yousafzai""",7DEoIJD5wtn748fnsLb7mI,"Malala's $3M Afghan Aid, Taliban Rebuke, & Sports Equality Push","Malai Yousafzai BioSnap a weekly updated Biography.In recent days Malala Yousafzai has made headlines with several significant developments underscoring both her evolving advocacy and global influence. One of the biggest recent stories is her $3 million commitment through the Malala Fund to support girls education and women's rights in Afghanistan. In an Instagram announcement Malala detailed that the Afghanistan Initiative will provide grants to ten organizations including Education Bridge for Afghanistan Defenders of Equality and Rukhshana Media all dedicated to enabling Afghan girls to continue learning under Taliban rule and to making gender apartheid a recognized crime internationally. Outlets such as Dawn and Asia News Network report that this move comes amid ongoing Taliban bans on female education and follows her broader push to empower human rights defenders and spotlight the ongoing erasure of women from public life. The ICC’s recent arrest warrants against Taliban leaders for crimes against humanity have heightened the urgency of her intervention—a story making waves in human rights circles.On the activism front Malala used her platform at a major girls’ education summit in Islamabad to urge Muslim leaders not to legitimize the Taliban government. She made pointed remarks that the Taliban’s policies toward women amount to “gender apartheid” calling on leaders to show real power and not hide behind religion to justify oppression. Her comments have been widely quoted by both regional and global press underscoring her role as a thorn in the side of governments turned regressively patriarchal.Shifting gears but still on message Malala has also launched a high-profile new initiative called Recess to champion girls’ and women’s participation in sports. Announced in London at the Billie Jean King Power of Women’s Sport Summit and backed by sports legends like Billie Jean King herself the program pushes for both grassroots access and investment in pro-women’s leagues such as the WNBA and NWSL. Recess is a deeply personal project co-founded with her husband sports executive Asser Malik driven by her memory of exclusion from playgrounds as a girl in Pakistan. In interviews with CNN Sports and across her Instagram feed Malala says women’s sports are still dramatically underfunded and under-promoted—a gap she is determined to help close.Her public appearances have also included a more playful milestone—attending her “first ever proper concert” with Taylor Swift, as gleefully documented on social media and picked up by entertainment outlets. This lighter moment seemed to resonate widely with fans and young women worldwide, amplifying her image as relatable as well as formidable.Collectively these days have seen Malala not just reinforcing her standing as a leading advocate for girls’ education and rights but expanding into arenas like sports equality and public diplomacy. Headlines have ranged from “Malala Commits $3 Million to Afghan Girls” to “Malala Calls for Action Against Taliban Gender Apartheid” to “Malala Debuts Women’s Sports Initiative” and “Malala Joins the Swifties.” All of these underscore her relentless drive for women’s empowerment, whether in classrooms, legislatures, sports arenas, or the global spotlight. No unconfirmed reports have surfaced—her recent activities are well-documented, with her signature combination of gravitas and youth culture appeal very much intact.Get the best deals https://amzn.to/3ODvOtaThis content was created in partnership and with the help of Artificial Intelligence AI",https://open.spotify.com/episode/7DEoIJD5wtn748fnsLb7mI,2025-08-30,2AV6Hq6KWVvkf64rnVBhZt,Malala Yousafzai  - Audio Biography,Inception Point Ai,1761057428.7527955

Just this week, she leveraged her Nobel laureate platform with force, calling on India and Pakistan to de-escalate their rising tensions. On X, formerly Twitter, Malala urged both countries’ leaders to protect children and civilians, clearly stating, ""Hatred and violence are our common enemies, not each other."" She pressed for the international community to take diplomatic action now, warning that only dialogue promises real security and prosperity. This statement, widely picked up by international outlets like The Business Standard, positioned her once again as a major voice for peace in South Asia, with the potential for this intervention to be a headline moment with long-term regional impact.Barely a week ago, Malala made an emotional, highly secretive return to her childhood hometown in Shangla, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, after thirteen years away—a poignant trip first reported by Arab News. The last time she was in that valley, she was the target of a Taliban attack—an event that catapulted her to global advocacy. On this recent visit, she shared nostalgia-filled moments on X, recalling time spent by the rivers and reunions with beloved cousins, and expressed her hope to return again and again. The security surrounding her visit—AFP confirmed the area was sealed off—speaks to her unique mix of global stature and local vulnerability. She also extended condolences to victims of a recent attack in Bannu, using her platform to highlight ongoing violence in the region.On the pop culture front, Malala and her husband Asser Malik made an eye-catching Oscars debut, as covered by AOL. Her sequined hooded gown turned heads and made headlines, marking her growing presence in worlds far beyond activism. Social media lit up with her dazzling appearance, with fashion and culture commentators quick to note this crossover.Malala remains as outspoken as ever, recently clapping back at comments from Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan, who controversially linked Pashtun culture to girls’ exclusion from education in Afghanistan. She reminded the world—via the TBS News and Khaama Press—that she almost lost her life defying this very ideology.

Arriving in Islamabad for a major global summit on girls’ education in the Islamic world, Malala described herself as overwhelmed and happy to be back in Pakistan, a country she last visited only rarely since surviving the infamous 2012 Taliban attack. As reported by Asharq Al-Awsat, she intends to use her address to the summit to hold leaders accountable for the ongoing denial of education rights to girls in Afghanistan, calling out the Taliban for what she described as gender apartheid. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was set to open the conference, which brings together Muslim-majority nations in hopes of igniting regional action for girl’s education. On social media and directly from the conference, Malala’s message was clear: defending the rights of Afghan women and girls is non-negotiable, and she implores world leaders to reject silence.In an interview with Vatican News, Malala amplified her stance, telling Alessandro Gisotti that the scale of Taliban oppression is almost unimaginable and far exceeds mere gender discrimination. She explained how girls and women are banned from education, work, and even simple pleasures like visiting parks or raising their voices publicly—a level of control she considers a form of gender apartheid, not just discrimination. Malala’s remarks were widely quoted by advocacy groups and global media, amplifying her call for universal access to education as the path to economic development, peace, and hope.Just days earlier, July 12 was recognized worldwide as Malala Day, honoring her birthday and her ongoing influence as a symbol of resilience and empowerment for young women, particularly as National Suicide Prevention Month campaigns in the US referenced her story as one of hope in the face of overwhelming adversity.

Malala Yousafzai,"""Malala Yousafzai""",2pExgW1hiVURYMctvZ0sE1,Resilience Redefined: Women Triumphing Over Adversity,"This is your Women's Stories podcast.Welcome to Women's Stories, a podcast where we delve into the inspiring narratives of women who have redefined resilience. Today, we're going to explore the theme of overcoming adversity through the lens of remarkable women.Imagine being in a war-torn country, where violence and despair seem endless. This was the reality for Leymah Gbowee, a Liberian woman who found herself in the midst of a civil war at just 17 years old. Yet, she never lost hope. Gbowee became a social worker and trauma counselor, working with former child soldiers. Her unwavering belief in the power of women's solidarity led to the formation of a nonviolent movement that brought together Christian and Muslim women. In 2003, this movement played a pivotal role in ending Liberia's civil war.But resilience isn't just about grand gestures; it's also about the everyday battles women face. Elena Crasmari, a woman with a disability from rural Moldova, wanted to run for a local counselor seat. Despite the challenges, she found strength in her community. Women's organizations and mentors supported her, inspiring her to take the first step. Today, as a local counselor, Elena works tirelessly to ensure that all parts of her community are accessible to everyone.Then there's Malala Yousafzai, who at 10 years old saw her city in Swat Valley, Pakistan, fall under Taliban control. Girls were banned from going to school, but Malala refused to give up. She continued to advocate for girls' education, even after surviving an assassination attempt. Her resilience in the face of adversity has inspired millions around the world.Narjis Mohaisen, who lost her eyesight at 13, is another testament to the power of resilience. She didn't let her disability hold her back. After graduating from university, Narjis dedicated herself to helping students with disabilities pursue their dreams. Her own experiences overcoming physical challenges inspire and encourage others.These women, and many like them, remind us that resilience is not just about overcoming obstacles but about inspiring others to do the same. Their stories are not just tales of survival but teachings on leadership, determination, empathy, ambition, and wisdom.As we reflect on these narratives, we're reminded that resilience is a choice, a choice to keep hope alive, to find strength in community, and to never give up. These women's stories redefine resilience for us, showing us that no matter what challenges we face, we have the power to overcome them and inspire others along the way.Join us next time on Women's Stories as we continue to explore the inspiring narratives of women who have redefined resilience.

We put AOC and Bernie Sanders’ CNN town hall under the microscope and it’s totally ridiculous. AOC’s attempts to artfully dodge a direct question on illegal immigrants is proof she's planning a major political move.   🫏 How about the most damning example of Democratic orthodoxy: the swift retribution against Senator John Fetterman. Fetterman, who votes with his party 96% of the time, dared to utter the truth on cable news: Democrats shut down the government, and the ""health care"" crisis they blame on Republicans was a funding cliff they designed. His honesty was immediately met with hostility.  🇺🇸 CBP Director Rodney Scott. Scott joins the Progrum and confirms that the security situation rapidly improved because of Trump's moves.

Chapo Trap House can certainly boast a wildly devoted fan base (and a not insignificant degree of media influence), but their audience is roughly half the size of Kulinski’s.While Secular Talk might be more likely to be looped in with the progressive networks around Air America and Pacifica alums like Sam Seder than the more resolutely socialist world, Kulinski’s fiery rhetoric, razor-sharp class instincts, and knack for withering takedowns sets him apart from his peers. Judging by his rhetoric alone, he’s closer to a Eugene Debs than a Chris Hayes.But unlike Hayes, Amy Goodman, or his friend Cenk Uygur of The Young Turks — who began airing Secular Talk on his web network seven years ago — the thirty-two-year-old Kulinski is virtually invisible in the mainstream media. Despite his enormous fan base, his show has never once been mentioned in the obligatory trend pieces on “the Millennial Left” pumped out by the prestige media. Nor has Kulinski’s name ever popped up at all in the New York Times, Vox, the New Yorker, New York Magazine, or the Washington Post, despite his leading role in cofounding Justice Democrats, the organization widely credited with sweeping Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the rest of “the Squad” to power.Just last week, his Wikipedia page was deleted. The reason? “There is very simply no [reliable source] coverage of this person,” according to one moderator. In new media, he’s king — the Sean Hannity of the Berniecrat left. In old media, he’s nobody.I suspect there are a few reasons for that. There is nothing “cool” about Kulinski’s show. (As a friend put it, “‘Welcome to Secular Talk’ sounds like something you’d hear on Egyptian radio.”) His no-nonsense social-democratic politics won’t get him much cred with the Full Communism crowd. He records his show not in Brooklyn or Los Angeles, but in a studio he built himself in his modest Westchester home. His hair is too groomed and his taste in clothes too preppy to qualify as “Dirtbag Left.” Nor has he ever attended an n+1 release party. “Not only have I not attended one,” he says, “I have no idea what that means.”And yet he’s astonishingly plugged-in for a young man in the suburbs. Wondering how Sanders ended up on the Joe Rogan Experience? Kulinski, a frequent guest on Rogan’s wildly popular show, introduced them. “You make the most sense to me,” Rogan told Kulinski on a recent episode. “You’re a normal person.”Much like Sanders himself, Kulinski’s show has a massive audience that just doesn’t compute with our media’s understanding of “what the kids want” or even “what the left-wing kids want.”It’s probably for the best — the very woke and very WASP-ish decorum haunting much of the media world is nowhere to be found in Secular Talk. “Corporate Democrats over-focus on identity as a trick to divert you from the issues that unite us all — class issues,” he said on a recent episode. “That Raytheon decided they don’t hate gays or trans people — frankly, I don’t really give a shit what their take on that is...""Read More Here!: https://jacobinmag.com/2020/03/kyle-kulinski-bernie-bros-secular-talk-joe-rogan-youtube #KyleKulinski #SecularTalk ",https://open.spotify.com/episode/0HQDweW0ugMSx3hMDSb1JJ,2025-09-18,5OGGuJD0txpWV0QOETTcjU,The Kyle Kulinski Show,Kyle Kulinski,1761057430.597726

Bernie Sanders spent $78,371 on private jet charters between July and September, adding to over $450,000 in similar expenditures in the prior six months, totaling more than half a million dollars this year on luxury air travel. This is supposed to be the man of the people? These Marxists are sickening.  Also, Speaker Mike Johnson is calling out the Democrat party for what they are – Marxists and Socialists. They’ll be attending a No Kings rally this weekend but who’s funding this? This is not a bottom-up spontaneous movement. Later, Zohran Mamdani is an Islamist jihadist who represents the terrorist wing of Islamism rather than Muslims. Mamdani won't condemn Hamas or acknowledge inequalities in places like Qatar. His policies would cause economic shortages and dislocation in NYC. Finally, the Gaza peace deal should not mark the end of the peace process. True, lasting peace requires addressing the root cause: Islamist terrorism, which originates primarily in the Middle East and is funded, promoted, and exported by countries like Qatar through outlets such as Al Jazeera.  Arab and Muslim nations need to stop harboring, funding, and appeasing terrorist groups like Hamas, Hezbollah, Houthis, ISIS, and the Muslim Brotherhood. Trump is uniquely qualified to extend the deal's unity into a bold initiative to unravel, isolate, and eliminate these threats, leveraging relationships with nations that fear terrorists while pressuring others.

The move follows allegations detailed in accuser Virginia Giuffre’s upcoming posthumous memoir, as King Charles and Prince William reportedly urged him to step back further from royal duties. In a statement, Prince Andrew said “continued accusations” “distract from the work of the royal family,” though he continues to deny the allegations against him.    Don Allison and Marcus Cheffen's paths first crossed during a violent robbery in 1996. Years later, they reconnected through a restorative justice program, finding common ground in faith, empathy, and a mission to help others reenter society. Sen. Bernie Sanders joins “CBS Mornings” to talk about the funding fight in Congress as the government shutdown enters day 20, how people should harness the energy of the ""No Kings"" protests and his new book, “Fight Oligarchy.”    Former White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, who served under Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, joins ""CBS Mornings"" to discuss her new book ""Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines."" She explains why she left the Democratic Party after two decades to become an Independent. Anastasia Soare, founder of Anastasia Beverly Hills, joins ""CBS Mornings"" to share how perfecting brows turned her into a global beauty mogul. She also reflects on escaping communism in Romania and shaping Hollywood's eyebrow obsession.

Bernie Sanders,"""Bernie Sanders""",4cBH4lvANczMYBe3FSzYfD,"MSNBC Is Being Very, Very Calm About Bernie Sanders","On Saturday, what most pollsters, politicos, and Bernie Sanders campaign organizers had been saying for days, if not weeks, proved true: namely, that the Democratic Socialist candidate for president had been well-poised for victory in Nevada, the most diverse state in the race thus far. Since the AP was able to call the race early in the day, the punditry had all the time they needed to speak to the moment. But, Columbia Journalism Review's Jon Allsop observed, despite the fact that Sanders's win had been predicted by analysts across the board, the day-of analysis had an unmistakable vibe of alarm. In this podcast extra, Bob and Allsop discuss the latest friction between the Sanders campaign and MSNBC, and what the network is doing — and can do moving forward — to avoid any repeat of Saturday's blunders. CORRECTION: Iowa, not Nevada, is the most populous state to have already cast votes in the 2020 election.  On the Media is supported by listeners like you.

In his new book, Bernie Sanders Guide to Political Revolution, he distills what he’s learned into a how-to for grassroots activists. But with Hillary Clinton still on a book-tour putting part of the blame for Trump’s victory on Sanders, the self-described socialist is clearly feeling contentious, and puts plenty of blame back on Clinton and an “upper-middle-class” Democratic party, which he joined in 2015 to run for president.

Bernie Sanders,"""Bernie Sanders""",0H1v5ETriw2XZy3OAC8nEF,8/11/25 - MAGA's Resilience: Why Epstein Didn't Hurt Trump,"On Monday's Mark Levin Show, the Democratic Party continues to strive to link President Trump to the Epstein case. Unfortunately, no details are being revealed because of the case's sensitive nature, not due to any attempt to hide information by Trump. It is impossible to force the grand jury to reveal this information, as that would infringe upon the privacy rights that are fundamental to every case during its jurisdiction. These so-called influencers are promoting the Epstein issue as a significant concern, yet a CNN poll conducted by Harry Enten shows that interest in the Epstein matter has waned considerably. in addition, we need to exercise extreme caution regarding whom we place our trust in moving forward, as there are numerous backstabbers, particularly when it involves attacking Trump. Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene serves as a prime example - many admired her, but the tables have turned as she is a deceitful and sleazy politician. Do we truly want individuals like her to represent us? Absolutely not. This is precisely why she is experiencing a significant decline in support due to her abhorrent actions, and yet she has the nerve to assert that she leads MAGA, which is utterly embarrassing. Also, Washington D.C is getting more dangerous. Just like in NYC and in California, crime is just as bad in Washington D.C.. Trump has a plan to help combat the crime that has been present and affecting the community. Moreover, individuals such as Sen Bernie Sanders pose a significant threat, and it is disheartening to see someone like Dana Bash fawning over Sanders, which is likely contributing to her declining ratings. Sanders endorses the actions of Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela, supports Zohran Mamdani's campaign for Mayor of NYC, and advocates for the erosion of our freedoms through Socialism and Marxism.  Lastly, Benjamin Netanyahu isn't going to stop destroying Hamas, until Gaza is free of them. Netanyahu is determined to release all the hostages, and will not stop until they are all home and safe.

The state's electorate is considerably older and whiter than that of the nearly all of the remaining contests. Despite this result, both candidates face an uphill climb to the nomination because of a dearth of support from voters of color.Former Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren both under-performed expectations. Neither secured any delegates in the state, with their vote totals falling below the necessary 15 percent threshold.This episode: congressional correspondent Susan Davis and campaign correspondents Asma Khalid and Scott Detrow.Connect:Subscribe to the NPR Politics Podcast here.Email the show at nprpolitics@npr.org.Join the NPR Politics Podcast Facebook Group.Subscribe to the NPR Politics Newsletter.Find and support your local public radio station.Learn more about sponsor message choices: podcastchoices.com/adchoicesNPR Privacy Policy",https://open.spotify.com/episode/068r8OVWdzSXs7sx5VGV4X,2020-02-12,2PnWnDNwU3wKesCHCpy252,The NPR Politics Podcast,NPR,1761057432.730972

He is the biggest liar running for president besides Joe Biden. Sanders has pandered to the communists for his entire career praising Fidel Castro and the Nicaraguan Sandinistas because of how impressed he was with them. Then, Mike Bloomberg is a multi-billionaire with private security and private jets and spends a ton of money attacking our second amendment rights. He fails to recognize that China's leader is a dictator. Bloomberg expanded his business from New York to China and has been there for over 25 years in which time he's become cozy with the communists in order to do business there. Afterward, Martha Raddatz from ABC News laments that Iranians are supporting America and taking umbrage against the Ayatollah for 'accidentally' killing innocents aboard a Ukrainian commercial flight.

Bernie Sanders,"""Bernie Sanders""",0YRI3MXtInKfMcj8y6oGsA,Dem Senate Hopeful's Disturbing Reaction to the 9/11 Terrorists,"Join Jim and Greg for the Tuesday 3 Martini Lunch as they serve up three disturbing but important martinis. They dig into a Democratic Senate candidate’s shocking post-9/11 comments, the latest grim polling in the New York City mayor’s race, and the sharp cultural divide between pro-Trump and pro-Kamala Gen Z voters.First, they react to reports that Maine Democrat U.S. Senate candidate Graham Platner wrote in 2002 that we should try to understand the motivations of the 9/11 terrorists because ""one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter."" Platner was in high school at the time and subsequently served four overseas deployments as a U.S. Marine. But he is also publicly touting his student activism as part of his campaign. He is also strongly anti-Israel and enthusiastically aligns himself with Bernie Sanders.Next, Jim and Greg recoil at the latest New York Times/Siena College poll showing socialist Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani with a commanding lead in the New York City mayor’s race. While numbers tighten in a hypothetical two-person race, it's not a two-person race. They also wince at Mamdani's recent comments about why he wants government-run grocery stores, when they have a long track record of failure.Finally, they go through the numbers of an NBC News poll, as Gen Z men who voted for President Trump have much different and much more traditional ideas of what constitutes success compared to Gen Z women who voted for Kamala Harris. The differences are especially stark on whether marriage and children are a big part of being successful.Please visit our great sponsors:Support your health with Dose Daily.  Save 25% on your first month when you subscribe at https://DoseDaily.co/3ML or enter code 3ML at checkout. Find the right support that’s right for you with BetterHelp.

Yes, yes it is. Ok. Deep breaths. For my season finale, I bring you the one and only Bernie Sanders: the longest-serving independent member of Congress in American history; unofficial leader of the US progressive movement and a two-time former Presidential candidate.He joins me to talk about his failed attempts to win the Democratic Party nomination, his failure to make his high school basketball team and the time he unwittingly went viral for wearing a pair of mittens to President Biden's inauguration. It's a conversation that will make you think and possibly make you angry (but that, as he explains, can be a good thing).It was an honour to meet Senator Sanders and although he doesn't much like talking about himself, I gave it my best shot. I think this is probably his most personal interview yet. I found his reflections on how his childhood shaped his political outlook really fascinating. And I posed so many questions about whether he cries and where he puts his disappointment that he actually asked me if it was a therapy session. My answer? 'Basically, yes.' He had the good grace to laugh.--Bernie Sanders's new book, It's Ok To Be Angry About Capitalism is out now and available to order here.--My new book, FRIENDAHOLIC: Confessions of a Friendship Addict, is published on 30th March and is now available to preorder - at half price - here.--How To Fail With Elizabeth Day is hosted and produced by Elizabeth Day.

AOC’s attempts to artfully dodge a direct question on illegal immigrants is proof she's planning a major political move.   🫏 How about the most damning example of Democratic orthodoxy: the swift retribution against Senator John Fetterman. Fetterman, who votes with his party 96% of the time, dared to utter the truth on cable news: Democrats shut down the government, and the ""health care"" crisis they blame on Republicans was a funding cliff they designed. His honesty was immediately met with hostility.  🇺🇸 CBP Director Rodney Scott. Scott joins the Progrum and confirms that the security situation rapidly improved because of Trump's moves.

Putin to stay out of the presidential election.Intelligence officials warned House lawmakers last week that Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get the president re-elected. Mr. Trump was angry the intelligence briefing was held at all.What exactly do intelligence officials mean by “interference”?

Sanders is lifting ideas from chapter 10 of the USSR Constitution for what he's proposing as his platform for President of The United States. Then, Clinton hitman and pseudo-journalist George Stephanopoulos tries to set-up President Trump with a gotcha question in a recent interview. Trump pushes back saying he'd have to check out the hypothetical information Stephanopoulos mentioned before calling the FBI for simply receiving opposition research. Stephanopoulos never asked Hillary Clinton if he thought it was wrong for Hillary’s campaign to hire a law firm, that hired a consulting firm, that hired an ex-British spy to provide opposition research obtained from Russian's — which actually did happen! Later, former Vice President Joe Biden's son continues to face criticism over dubious dealings with China and Ukraine.

We discuss where the electability conversation often goes off-the-rails, why discussing electability in 2020 is so different than 1964 or 1972, the case for and against Bernie’s electability prospects, and the strongest attacks that Trump could make against Sanders and Joe Biden.  Then, we discuss Ezra’s favorite topic of all time: the filibuster. Ezra gives a brief history of this weird procedural tool, and we discuss why so many current Senators are against eliminating it.

In this episode of Ways to Change the World, the US Senator tells Krishnan Guru-Murthy why the US should stop its funding for Netanyahu’s “horrific war against the Palestinian people”, why a second Trump victory could foment right-wing movements across the world with disastrous consequences, and why taking on the ruling class is a necessary but “long, long process”.

Bernie Sanders,"""Bernie Sanders""",41qOrfpijJC9disCXcABdK,Hour 3 - Race Communism ,"Hour 3 of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show delivers a dynamic and wide-ranging discussion centered on President Donald Trump’s bold political maneuvers, international diplomacy, and the shifting political landscape in America. The hour opens with commentary on Trump’s temporary federalization of the DC Metro Police, a move prompted by rising violent crime in the nation’s capital. The hosts highlight the contrast between past strict enforcement on minor offenses like fake IDs and the current leniency toward serious crimes such as carjackings. They emphasize Trump’s appointment of Judge Jeanine Pirro as U.S. Attorney for DC, praising her tough-on-crime stance and potential to override local prosecutors in federal cases involving drugs and firearms. The conversation transitions to Trump’s upcoming meeting with Vladimir Putin, framing it as a pivotal moment in global diplomacy. Trump’s strategy to end the war in Ukraine includes leveraging tariffs on India for purchasing discounted Russian oil, thereby pressuring Putin economically. The hosts analyze the geopolitical implications of this move, suggesting it may have forced Putin to the negotiating table. They also reflect on Trump’s unique ability to command media attention and shape the national narrative, noting a possible softening of the press corps’ stance toward him. Throughout the hour, the hosts critique the Democratic Party’s reliance on race-based politics, arguing that Trump’s policies are resonating with Black and Latino voters, particularly on issues like crime and deportation. They cite growing disillusionment with movements like Black Lives Matter, which they claim have led to increased violence and failed to deliver meaningful change. The discussion includes data on rising support for Trump among Black men, with one in five reportedly voting for him in 2024—a shift the hosts describe as “transformative.” Listeners also weigh in with talkbacks, sparking a lighthearted debate about the tallest mountains in the U.S., including Mount Mitchell and Mount Rainier. The hour closes with reflections on the enduring appeal of Bernie Sanders, critiques of Democratic leadership, and a call for broader media engagement across platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram.

Bernie Sanders,"""Bernie Sanders""",5IzN4e9Ec3GWiXakpCnQpd,Virtue Hoarders and the Rejection of Liberalism (w/ Catherine Liu) | The Chris Hedges Report,"The material needs of working class people in America continue to be obscured and co-opted by politicians and people claiming to know what’s best on both sides of the political aisle. While Republicans and right-wingers address some of these needs head on, they do so by luring people through empty rhetoric and culture war distractions. On the other side, Democrats and liberals police and enforce a cancel-culture paradigm built by elites that also distracts and divides the proletariat from ever engaging in meaningful connection and change. Catherine Liu, a professor of film and media studies at the University of California, Irvine, joins host Chris Hedges on this episode of The Chris Hedges Report to discuss her new book, “Virtue Hoarders: The Case Against the Professional Managerial Class.” The PMC, as Liu calls it, is a group of courtiers made up of academics, media figures and cultural elites who hover above the working class and dictate the aesthetic direction of “progress,” notably without ever addressing the material needs of the workers it claims to look after. They stifle debate, discourage dissent and issue dire punishments of anyone who dare challenge their rationale. After the victory of Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election, the liberal PMC blame “people who are concerned with bread and butter issues for the defeat of these candidates that have been promoted by [Democrats,] a party completely captured by one segment of capital who are trying to show the American worker that they are idiots, they are racist, they're anti-immigrant, they're transphobic, they're homophobic, they're sexist,” Liu tells Hedges. Liu points to a podcast appearance by Democratic campaign managers and their response to not combating Trump on a simple advertisement because of focus group testing as an example of the PMC’s disconnection from their constituents. “They were in a box. They didn't go outside. They didn't talk to Americans. They didn't talk to people. They don't know people.”",https://open.spotify.com/episode/5IzN4e9Ec3GWiXakpCnQpd,2025-02-12,1GcaOdYEcRPYYRrYodZsDe,The Chris Hedges Report,Chris Hedges,1761057436.018197

President Trump should run as the Pro-America incumbent — it's really that simple. Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg are out of the race and Sanders has always rejected the Democrat Party because they were too far to the right for his Marxist policies. Trump is either going to run against a Marxist or a moron and we have a moral imperative to defeat the ideas that fuel these campaigns. Later, Sanders has a multi-decade reputation of sympathizing with communists and if elected he will destroy jobs. It’s not the D.C establishment against Sanders, nor are we nationalists/populists because nationalism and populism overlap with democratic socialism and are antithetical to Americanism, republicanism, and our Constitution.

And for the next two episodes, we’re going to showcase two very different ones.Faiz Shakir was Bernie Sanders’s 2020 campaign manager, and he believes that Democrats need to embrace a Sanders-style class-first populism. This question of whether Sanders or a candidate like him could have beaten Trump loomed over Democratic post-mortems of the 2016 election, and they’ve reared up again this year, as Democrats have continued to lose working-class voters. As Sanders put it in a blistering statement: “It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working-class people would find that the working class has abandoned them.”But some Democrats have been frustrated with this criticism. President Biden has been arguably the most economically populist president of the modern era. And the Democrats who have been winning in redder parts of the country aren’t democratic socialists. So I wanted to have Shakir on for a lively debate. Shakir worked not just for Sanders; he was also a senior adviser to the Senate majority leader Harry Reid and to Nancy Pelosi. And he’s currently the founder and executive director of More Perfect Union, a media outlet focused on issues affecting America’s working class.This episode contains strong language.Book Recommendations:The Tyranny of Merit by Michael J.

Bernie Sanders,"""Bernie Sanders""",0mv00ZQikqfd6o4YzmHrWw,What would a Sanders or Biden presidency look like?,"Super Tuesday winnowed the 2020 Democratic primary race down to two candidates: Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. So how would their presidencies actually differ? Who would staff their administrations? How would they handle Congress? How would they handle key foreign policy decisions? What are their likely points of failure? How would they change the Democratic Party? I asked my friend, colleague, and Weeds co-host Matt Yglesias to join me for this conversation, and it was a good one. We’ve both covered Biden and Sanders for a long time, but come away with somewhat different impressions of each. The points where we differ here were, for me, even more helpful than the points where we agreed. I'll be interested, as always, to hear your thoughts: ezrakleinshow@vox.com.

The Berlin Wall has crumbled! Communism has fallen! Capitalism wins! USA! USA! But wait… what’s this? Russia has been overtaken by oligarchs and an authoritarian dictator. Oh no… Well, at least that could never happen in the United States. Right? This is the climactic Part Three of our three-part series on the history of the left/right political spectrum. After the youth protests of the 1960s failed to topple governments, left-wing radicalism shifted its focus—from revolution to championing social equality through pop culture. But as culture wars raged, neoliberalism—liberalism and capitalism’s love child—conquered the globe, fueling deregulation, rising corporate power, and deepening economic divides that hollowed out democracy itself. Just three decades after the Cold War, the old adversaries—Russia and the U.S.—found themselves on eerily parallel paths, ushering in a new era of oligarchy and a return to right-wing rule—like the one the French Revolution fought against all those years ago. Join us as we trace how the world drifted from dreams of liberation to authoritarian control—and how a new generation began planting the seeds of liberty and equality once again.     If you’d like to support Human Nature Odyssey, please subscribe wherever you enjoy your podcasts, leave us a review, and visit humannatureodyssey.com.

Bernie Sanders,"""Bernie Sanders""",51WOQq4Wc9OcBMuQmOh2y6,Marxism Unmasked: Levin vs. AOC and Bernie,"On Friday’s Mark Levin Show, Rep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) and Sen Bernie Sanders are staunch Marxists, even though AOC shows she has never deeply read the texts of Marx or Hegel. Marxism is all about slogans, skills Sanders excels at while AOC is still developing. There isn’t one place where Marxism has worked, yet this is what they push. Later, there is this fusion between Marxism and Islamism. The People’s Forum, a pro-Communist Chinese Party (CCP) Marxist group, is orchestrating protests to free Mahmoud Khalil. The group has ties to radical left-wing organizations like Code Pink and has a history of supporting anti-Israel and pro-Palestinian causes, including celebrating Hamas attacks. Also, the mainstream media is downplaying the fact that Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown University student facing deportation by the Trump administration, is the son-in-law of a senior Hamas official, Yousef Saleh. The media portray Suri as merely a researcher or student caught in a legal dispute, ignoring his alleged ties to Hamas and his promotion of antisemitic propaganda on social media. Afterward, Jim Trusty calls in to discuss the Trump administration facing an unprecedented number of legal injunctions, far surpassing those of any previous president. This is the continuing of lawfare. In addition, leftwing conflicted Obama judge, James Boasberg, is looking to hold the Trump administration in contempt. That's what he's doing, and he wants to make a big splash, get lots of media headlines, and try to sabotage the Trump administration. He wants to create the impression that Trump is lawless when, in fact, Boasberg is lawless. He wants to play into the Democrat Party narrative that Trump is a dictator, when it is Boasberg who is the autocrat. Finally, Jim Simpson joins the conversation to talk about his new book, Manufactured Crisis: The War to End America. https://www.amazon.com/Manufactured-Crisis-War-End-America/dp/B0DGD854FS/ Learn more about your ad choices.

Bernie Sanders,"""Bernie Sanders""",1xbsYSHQD9wqxfEgoT4WEl,Mark Levin Audio Rewind - 2/20/20,"On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, WJNO Host Brian Mudd fills in. Bernie Sanders is the Coronavirus, in so much as the threat of his campaign is diminishing — but it still has potential to hurt you. Sen. Elizabeth Warren went in for the knock-out punch on rival Mike Bloomberg in Wednesday’s Democrat debate. Warren's performance may have earned her a much needed round of fundraising for her campaign. While the critics are down-playing Bloomberg's performance, all we need to do is look back to 2016 when they said Trump was easily beatable. Of course today's field of Democrats that want to take away your freedoms are a far cry from the JFK Democrats who embraced America. The elimination of charter schools, abolish electoral college, and no limits on abortion are the policies of the so-called moderate, Pete Buttigieg. Then, phase one of the trade deal with China eliminated tariffs on billions of dollars’ worth of goods. But, that kind of trade will disappear if Sanders gets elected. Economic growth during President Obama's tenure was 1.8% and average people's finances went backwards, this is the exact opposite of what is happening on President Trump's watch. Later, Joe Biden was the muscle of the Obama Administration and we can all thank him for making our health care costs 90% more expensive. Learn more about your ad choices.

Bernie Sanders says we should lower the age for Medicare eligibility. Sanders brazenly lies forgetting that Medicare was going to take care of healthcare for poor people, then Obamacare was supposed to fix everything but it didn't, now medicare is the cure-all but it’s not. It's just more massive government regulations. Then, Joe Biden's plan to legalize illegal immigrants, give instant asylum, free education and healthcare will flood the United States beyond capacity and destroy the current way of life. Later, major American cities, run by Democrats have in effect seceded from the country. At first, they were sanctuary cities, however, the Democrats have always been about secession and segregation. Afterward, Jason Whitlock from Outkick.com calls in to explain how America's enemies have infiltrated sports because sports are such a big deal in American culture. Adding that communist China and ""the puppet masters"" are pulling the strings on professional sports and its players so that they can smear America. Finally, GOP Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy joins the show to announce new legislation to protect American monuments and statues.

We discuss where the electability conversation often goes off-the-rails, why discussing electability in 2020 is so different than 1964 or 1972, the case for and against Bernie’s electability prospects, and the strongest attacks that Trump could make against Sanders and Joe Biden.  Then, we discuss Ezra’s favorite topic of all time: the filibuster.

Rhodes Scholar. Assistant to U.S. Solicitor General Robert Bork. Director of policy planning at the Federal Trade Commission under Carter. Secretary of Labor for Bill Clinton. Candidate for governor of Massachusetts. Co-founder of the American Prospect (where I got my first job in journalism!). Member of Barack Obama's economic transition team. Author of bestselling book after bestselling book. Professor. Viral video star. Documentary maker.More recently, Reich has emerged as perhaps the most persuasive (and, on Facebook, widely shared) surrogate for Bernie Sanders. It's a turn that likely would have surprised Reich's younger self — he worked with Hillary Clinton in college, was close friends with Bill Clinton at Oxford, and served Secretary of Labor during Bill Clinton's first term.Among the topics Reich and I cover:- His early relationship with the Clintons, including the time he went on a date with Hillary Clinton- His effort to create an experimental, participatory alternative to college at Dartmouth- The three policies he would change first to curb inequality- The story behind his co-founding of the American Prospect — the magazine that gave me my first job in journalism- What Bernie Sanders is like in person, and how that does or doesn't differ from his public persona- How to communicate effectively about public policy- Whether inequality or political polarization is the root cause of government dysfunction- His relationship with his mentor, John Kenneth GalbraithAnd there is, honestly, much, much more. Reich is, as you'll hear, an incredible storyteller, a sharp thinker, and a very fun guy to talk to, Enjoy!This episode of The Ezra Klein Show is brought to you by The Great Courses Plus.

They dig into a Democratic Senate candidate’s shocking post-9/11 comments, the latest grim polling in the New York City mayor’s race, and the sharp cultural divide between pro-Trump and pro-Kamala Gen Z voters.First, they react to reports that Maine Democrat U.S. Senate candidate Graham Platner wrote in 2002 that we should try to understand the motivations of the 9/11 terrorists because ""one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter."" Platner was in high school at the time and subsequently served four overseas deployments as a U.S. Marine. But he is also publicly touting his student activism as part of his campaign. He is also strongly anti-Israel and enthusiastically aligns himself with Bernie Sanders.Next, Jim and Greg recoil at the latest New York Times/Siena College poll showing socialist Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani with a commanding lead in the New York City mayor’s race. While numbers tighten in a hypothetical two-person race, it's not a two-person race. They also wince at Mamdani's recent comments about why he wants government-run grocery stores, when they have a long track record of failure.Finally, they go through the numbers of an NBC News poll, as Gen Z men who voted for President Trump have much different and much more traditional ideas of what constitutes success compared to Gen Z women who voted for Kamala Harris. The differences are especially stark on whether marriage and children are a big part of being successful.Please visit our great sponsors:Support your health with Dose Daily.  Save 25% on your first month when you subscribe at https://DoseDaily.co/3ML or enter code 3ML at checkout. Find the right support that’s right for you with BetterHelp.

Bernie Sanders,"""Bernie Sanders""",54OnfYIAg8OfEOmOYRtbDl,Ep. 24: 'America's Undoing' and the Right-Wing Message Machine,"SYNOPSIS: In the South, the prospects for progressive causes and candidates can be daunting. But Corbin Trent thinks the answer is not to back down or dilute their messages — it’s to take strong, bold positions on behalf of the region’s working people. Trent has been fighting for progressive values for a long time. He was a cofounder of the influential PAC Justice Democrats, and served as communications director for New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. A native and resident of Tennessee, he is now the creator of “America’s Undoing,” a new media project that is developing an ambitious progressive agenda in response to President Donald Trump’s MAGA movement — and to the paralyzing inertia of what should be the opposition party. He talks about what Democrats are getting wrong, and how to move forward. Also, we take a look at a recent dust-up at Tennessee State University, the state’s only publicly-funded Historically Black University. Two white internet provocateurs attempting to follow in the late Charlie Kirk’s footsteps showed up on the Nashville campus recently. The result was an entirely manufactured confrontation designed to create clippable content for sharing across the right-wing media. We take a look at the incident, and at the way that seamless ecosystem works to generate endless right-wing outrage and, increasingly, to set the the agenda for conservative politicians in our Southern states. Finally, a tribute to Norman Jones, who died last week — a legendary drag queen and bar owner who was for decades a central figure in Arkansas’ LGBTQ communities.

Bernie Sanders,"""Bernie Sanders""",41qO693HBWE78QRODCw5RX,"Leftists vs. liberals, with Elizabeth Bruenig","What separates Obama-era liberalism from Sanders-style democratic socialism? What are the fights splitting and transforming the Democratic Party actually about? This is a conversation I’ve wanted to have for a while, in part because I often find myself simultaneously in these debates and confused by them. Sometimes, arguments that are framed as deep ideological disagreements seem to actually be about differing political judgments about what public and political institutions will permit. But perhaps those political judgments are just ideology posing as pragmatism. It’s easy to fall down the rabbit hole here.  Elizabeth Bruenig is an opinion columnist at the Washington Post, co-host of the podcast The Bruenigs, and a thoughtful champion of the democratic socialist worldview. I asked her on the show to help me trace the boundaries of this debate and highlight where the divides really are.  This is a conversation about ideology, but it’s also about the limits of persuasion, whether civility is a weapon wielded by the powerful, what Medicare-for-all means, the left’s definition of freedom, the contradictions of being “socially liberal and fiscally responsible,” Howard Schultz, and much more.

Bernie Sanders,"""Bernie Sanders""",03GWugUcrHWcegbqElqPBs,Socialism Is Supposed to Be a Working-Class Movement. Why Isn’t It?,"American socialists today find themselves in a tenuous position. Over the past decade, the left has become a powerful force in American politics. Bernie Sanders seriously contested two presidential primaries. Democratic socialists have won local, state and congressional races. Organizations like Democratic Socialists of America and socialist publications like Jacobin have become part of the political conversation.But the progressive left’s successes have been largely concentrated in well-educated, heavily blue districts, and the movement that claims to represent the interests of workers consistently fails to make meaningful inroads with working-class voters. As a result, socialists have struggled to build broad, lasting political power at any level of government.“We might feel more confident about the prospects for the left if, rather than a momentary shift leftward in liberal economic priorities or the rhetoric of certain parts of the mainstream media, there had been deeper inroads made among workers,” writes Bhaskar Sunkara. “There have been rare exceptions, but on the whole, it would be delusional to say that our ideological left has made a decade of progress merging with a wider social base.”Sunkara is the founding editor of Jacobin and the president of The Nation, two of the leading publications on the American left. He recently published an issue of Jacobin titled “The Left in Purgatory,” which attempts to grapple with the left’s failures, interrogate its political strategies and chart a path for American socialists to win over more working-class voters. So I invited him on the show to lay out where the left is now, and where he thinks it needs to go next.We discuss whether the left learned the wrong lessons from the Sanders 2016 campaign, why working-class voters across the world have increasingly abandoned left-wing parties, the fundamental error in Sanders’s theory of the 2020 electorate, why winning over working-class voters is just as much about a candidate’s aesthetic as it is about policy, why Sunkara is pessimistic that the socialists who came after Bernie will be able to match his widespread appeal, the “end of the A.O.C. honeymoon” on the left, what a “supply-side socialism” could look like, the tension between the left’s desire for government to do big things and its skepticism of concentrated power, why it costs so much to build in America, why Sunkara is worried about America’s “thin associative democracy” and more.Mentioned:“Brahmin Left versus Merchant Right: Changing Political Cleavages in 21 Western Democracies, 1948-2020” by Amory Gethin, Clara Martínez-Toledano and Thomas PikettyInfrastructure issue from Jacobin""The End of the A.O.C.

Paul Reubens, Pee-wee Herman star, was revealed to be gay, but everyone was too busy remembering his other scandals. Meanwhile, Doug Emhoff lands a cushy law firm job, and the guys joke about his work ethic — if it exists. They dive into RFK Jr.’s Senate hearing, where Bernie Sanders fixated on $26 baby onesies while ignoring his own real estate empire. Elizabeth Warren went after RFK Jr. for suing Big Pharma — conveniently forgetting her own corporate cash flow. Then, there’s the guy who scammed a casino by pretending to be a Native American chief, a scheme that lasted way longer than it should have. The Ozempic conversation gets weird, with Al Roker, Al Sharpton, and Ariana Grande becoming case studies in extreme weight loss gone wrong. The crew wonders why some people lose fat and gain ... an oddly long skull.

Bernie Sanders,"""Bernie Sanders""",4uXal1vjrq5FixoFRtXCWW,President Pete Buttigieg: Not What We Need.,"Pete Buttigieg is a legitimate star in the Democratic Party. Having moved his family to Michigan there was speculation that he might run for the governor’s office or become a Senator. But he turned down both options and instead set his sights on the 2028 Presidential election. In addition to making the rounds on multiple cable shows and podcasts to help rehabilitate the image of the Democratic Party, he recently held a massive town hall in Iowa, where he was victorious in the 2020 Caucus. But who is Pete Buttigieg and why do so many people consider him a frontrunner for the Democratic ticket in ‘28? His experience as a small city mayor and single term as Transportation Secretary in the Biden Administration would still make him one of the least experienced candidates in U.S. history. So why all the attention?

Bernie Sanders and other progressives on Wednesday applauded President Joe Biden’s words of support for Amazon workers—and rejected the White House’s attempt to temper the president’s statement, calling on the administration to proudly and unequivocally align itself with pro-worker efforts. A new survey released Wednesday shows that Democrats are losing electoral support among recipients of the expanded child tax credit, a monthly program that lapsed at the end of December after Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin opposed an extension. The governor of Texas said Wednesday that his state will start busing and flying undocumented immigrants to the nation’s capital, escalating his clash with the Biden administration over border policy and its plans to phase out pandemic-era restrictions. President Joe Biden again extended the moratorium of federal student loan debt on Wednesday morning. Payments are now set to resume after Aug. 31. Elon Musk was 11 days late in publicly declaring he had amassed a large stake in Twitter. That omission may have earned him $156 million.

Are we living through a crisis of vision, where our leaders offer no North Star to inspire the country?

Bernie Sanders,"""Bernie Sanders""",5vfs63kgIMP3TYLEcCewDh,A Home Run for Democracy?,"Maggie Daun welcomes GOP State Rep. Duke Tucker for a lively conversation on his proposal to implement term limits for Wisconsin state offices. Though the idea lacks widespread support in the legislature, Tucker makes the case that term limits could break the grip of career politicians and bring new energy into state governance. The discussion expands to broader democratic reforms—including campaign finance transparency and the outsized influence of incumbency. Tucker also shares reflections from his experience as a softball coach, drawing parallels between public service and teamwork, growth, and accountability. Finally, Maggie connects the dots between entrenched power, money in politics, and the barriers to a government truly accountable to the people.

Bernie Sanders,"""Bernie Sanders""",70uUTGfr1RL4rC4RDnAyGc,Here Comes the Pitch for Socialism,"I have a soft spot for the Dirtbag Left now that I never used to have. Listening to them viciously destroy the Democratic Party scratches that itch. They were ahead of the curve, and the Democrats would have been better off not snuffing out the movement way back when.But snuff it out, we did. Back in 2016, I was in a Facebook group devoted to doing nothing but hating on the “Bernie bros.” I spent too much of my precious time trying to stop them as a movement because they threatened Hillary Clinton’s win. Like every Democrat now, I was afraid of democracy.The Democrats find themselves in that place where the three characters from Jaws end up. They’ve tried harpoons and three barrels on him, and nothing has worked. They finally decide to try Hooper’s shark cage, even though Brody knows there’s no chance it will work. “You got any better suggestions?” barks Hooper.That Quint entertains the idea of bringing in Hooper’s cage at all was the miracle. And the desperation.The Democrats are ready for the anti-shark cage, and so Bernie Sanders and AOC are on a western tour to “stop the oligarchy.” They finally have the exact right enemy in Elon Musk and Bernie’s “billionaires.” Musk represents the death of their dream, that no one can get there on their wits, hard work, and ambition alone. No, this is a country where no one can rise unless everyone can rise.Trump’s tariffs are a potential solution to America’s crippling problem of income inequality that has destroyed the middle class. That’s the MAGA populism at work. Bernie's populism fixes the problem with much bigger government. The rich pay more to redistribute the wealth.Is this finally the moment when we can Make America Socialist Again? A major step forward from FDR’s New Deal and Johnson’s Great Society? Do the Democratic Socialists have a real shot at winning the nomination away from the feckless, flaccid centrists?Is this finally the moment when the Dirtbag Left and the identity politics utopians merge to create one big movement, a Green New Deal? Will Trump’s radical change finally be the thing that pushes the majority in a direction they never would have gone?Recent polls show that younger generations are much more accepting and fond of socialism than older generations. It's not that hard to do the math and see what might be coming next.How it StartedAccording to Neil Howe and William Strauss's 1997 book, 2008 was the crisis that sparked our Fourth Turning. This pattern plays out every 80 years, with each generation being born and living a lifetime before everything radically changes to restart America in a new direction, like the American Revolution, the Civil War, the Great Depression, and World War II.We still don’t know how big or how bad our Fourth Turning will be. To Strauss and Howe, the $700 billion bank bailout was the moment the public woke up to the imminent disaster of income inequality and a bloated oligarchy. The bailout birthed two populist movements: Occupy Wall Street and the Tea Party.Occupy Wall Street became the Bernie movement which, after Hillary’s loss in 2016, was dissolved into the Democrat machine. The Tea Party became Trump and MAGA. The question we have to ask is which side will prevail when the Fourth Turning comes to a close, when the policies are cemented and the country is united?According to Howe’s new book, The Fourth Turning is Here, he edges ever so slightly to the Left’s side of things because the dominant generation, the Millennials, are a “go along to get along” personality type.At the moment, at least to me, the MAGA side offers more for ambitious millennials, especially young men. MAGA is now the side of innovation and economic growth. If they succeed, there will be no need for a rescue mission.But if they fail? Ben Shapiro has been dropping the prediction for a few weeks now that if Trump’s economy begins to fail, the power that will rise is the equal and opposite reaction to Trump’s populism: a lurch to the hard left.Bernie and AOC are ready to bring the movement back.Is this finally the moment where both Bernie and AOC have the right kind of anger and the right enemy they need to tap into the collective outrage of all of those crazy people out there losing their minds?

Bernie Sanders,"""Bernie Sanders""",3E6nSAONc4oIaBd4GzzY9W,An Unusually Optimistic Conversation With Bernie Sanders,"Bernie Sanders didn’t win the 2020 election. But he may have won its aftermath.If you look back at Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders’s careers, the $1.9 trillion stimulus package, the American Rescue Plan, looks a lot like the proposals Sanders has fought for forever, without much of the compromise or concerns that you used to see from Senator Joe Biden. That’s not to take anything away from Biden. He’s the president. This is his plan. And it is to his credit that he saw what the country needed, what the politics of the moment would support and where his party had moved, and met it with full force.But Sanders’s two presidential campaigns are part of the reason that the Democratic Party had moved, and the politics of the moment had changed. And so I’ve wondered what Sanders makes of this moment. Is it a triumph? A disappointment? A beginning?And I’ve wondered about his take on some of the other questions swirling around the Democratic Party: Are liberals alienating people who agree with them on economics by being too censorious on culture?

Gallagher dissects this suicidal tendency with the perspective of someone who's witnessed decades of progressive movements building and fracturing.He describes how the Sanders campaigns temporarily broke through this cycle by demonstrating mass support for progressive policies and bringing people together around concrete goals. He contrasts this practical engagement with the sectarian tendencies that flourish especially in online spaces, where discourse lacks nuance and rewards extremism.The episode examine the challenges facing organizations like the Democratic Socialists of America as they navigate questions of electoral strategy, ideological consistency, and practical governance. The example of Zohran Mamdani's mayoral campaign in New York serves as a test case. How can a socialist be an effective mayor while maintaining progressive principles.Drawing on historical examples from Milwaukee's ""sewer socialists"" to the fragmentation of previous left movements, this discussion offers essential insights for anyone committed to building effective progressive power. Rather than treating disagreement as betrayal, Gallagher advocates recognizing common ground and directing our energy toward the actual systems of power and inequality that progressive movements exist to challenge.Support the show",https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uYFzzGJw4ri5O3X9VBCOZ,2025-09-21,6lGvEAmn9yU6RhhMvyMB8n,RevolutionZ,Michael Albert,1761057446.3208797

This reconnaissance briefing deconstructs his central arguments, from wealth inequality to the future of work in the age of AI.We analyze Sanders's framework for understanding the concentration of economic and political power and his proposed solutions.The key intelligence from our deep dive:  The Diagnosis - An Economy for the 1%: An analysis of Sanders's claim that the U.S. suffers from the worst income and wealth inequality in its history, with 60% of Americans living paycheck-to-paycheck while a handful of Wall Street firms effectively own corporate America.    The Political Engine - A Corrupt Campaign Finance System: Deconstructing his argument that the Citizens United Supreme Court decision has allowed a small number of billionaires to control both political parties, disciplining any politician who steps out of line.

The Next Frontier - Automation and the Crisis of Meaning: A look at the profound challenge posed by AI and automation.

Bernie Sanders,"""Bernie Sanders""",0vbqsPmdpGImtopc8X0xWl,"Ep 355 Tom Gallagher DSA, Mamdani, and Us","Episode 355 of RevolutionZ has as guest DSA activist and former Massachusetts state representative Tom Gallagher to discuss how leftists too often ""do the billionaires' work for them"" by attacking allies over ideological purity.When Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders face vicious criticism from fellow progressives with headlines like ""AOC is a genocidal con artist"" or ""Bernie is a ghoulish Zionist,"" something has gone terribly wrong with movement politics. Gallagher dissects this suicidal tendency with the perspective of someone who's witnessed decades of progressive movements building and fracturing.He describes how the Sanders campaigns temporarily broke through this cycle by demonstrating mass support for progressive policies and bringing people together around concrete goals. He contrasts this practical engagement with the sectarian tendencies that flourish especially in online spaces, where discourse lacks nuance and rewards extremism.The episode examine the challenges facing organizations like the Democratic Socialists of America as they navigate questions of electoral strategy, ideological consistency, and practical governance. The example of Zohran Mamdani's mayoral campaign in New York serves as a test case. How can a socialist be an effective mayor while maintaining progressive principles.Drawing on historical examples from Milwaukee's ""sewer socialists"" to the fragmentation of previous left movements, this discussion offers essential insights for anyone committed to building effective progressive power. Rather than treating disagreement as betrayal, Gallagher advocates recognizing common ground and directing our energy toward the actual systems of power and inequality that progressive movements exist to challenge.",https://open.spotify.com/episode/0vbqsPmdpGImtopc8X0xWl,2025-09-21,4WvYjSUYA5UxD1TJF3NKHL,RevolutionZ Patreon Feed,Michael Albert,1761057447.630627

Bernie Sanders,"""Bernie Sanders""",0RsY2NLazuf5ka39iRnVHb,Eps 602 - Bernie Sanders: Brilliant or Misguided,"Bernie Sanders is one of the most popular politicians in America today. Why would this be? In short, Senator Sanders is very good at understanding and paying attention to the problems of the masses. In some ways, he is ahead of the game. Many politicians don't even understand the problems facing Americans. They are simply looking for that winning issue, likely with NO intention of actually putting forth a workable solution.Bernie's problem, however, his solutions are all wrong.  It reminds of that scene in Hunt for Red October when Jack Ryan is explaining to Captain Ramius about the books he had written on the famous Captain.  Ramius admonished Ryan and told him his conclusions were all wrong.  Unfortunately there is nobody to set Senator Sanders on the righteous path. He is forever going around talking about real problems but offering no workable solutions.Bernie Sanders on Joe Rogan⁠https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Jo9ncrz2liWiKj8inZwD2?si=wmR7IhrnSBafil2xFjBp-g⁠Milton Friedman on Phil Donahue⁠https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ0-cDKMS5M⁠Seth Martin - Who Gets to Decide - Link Between Money and Standard of Living - Charts⁠https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHgUIr5SymM",https://open.spotify.com/episode/0RsY2NLazuf5ka39iRnVHb,2025-09-10,70DFBshd4WnYRtZztTJDOM,Who Gets to Decide?,Who Gets to Decide?,1761057447.6647775

Bernie Sanders,"""Bernie Sanders""",126n3wKQFhuMfUkgq111GN,26: How Bernie Sanders Is Making the Next Left Possible,"The roots of the Next Left podcast go back almost exactly a year—energized by the wave of progressive activism sweeping the country, we wanted to take a deep dive into the new politics of this moment. The idea was to talk politics with the people who were upending primaries and general elections across the country... by challenging incumbents, taking on party establishments and, above all, bringing fresh ideas to the campaign trail and to governance. Over the past six months, we’ve gone to Capitol Hill, where we met with members of ""the squad,"" like Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, and with people who are changing debates about foreign policy, like Congressional Progressive Caucus stalwarts Pramila Jayapal, Mark Pocan and Ro Khanna. We went to the basement of the state Capitol in Wisconsin, where newly-elected state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski explained how she's putting economics on the side of the people. We spoke with judges and district attorneys and city council members and mayors. We turned up the volume on messages from Texas and Mississippi and Puerto Rico and North Dakota. We talked mostly to political newcomers who had won elections against the odds, like Anna Eskamani in Florida, but also to activist officials who are building movements, such as Helen Gym in Philadelphia. We talked to new leaders who had won landslide victories, like Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba, and to new leaders who suffered narrow defeats but are not going anywhere, such as Tiffany Caban in Queens. We followed candidates who were up for election in 2019 and won epic victories, like Lee Carter in Virginia, Kshama Sawant in Seattle and Chesa Boudin in San Francisco. In every case, our conversations were about the personal and the political. Candidates talked about their ancestors and their children, about their communities, about the music they listen to-Ilhan Omar's a country fan-and about their role models and heroes.  We decided to finish the season by interviewing a pair of political veterans who were frequently mentioned by the young candidates and officials we interviewed. California Congresswoman Barbara Lee joined us last week. This week, for the final episode of the podcast, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders is our guest for a compelling conversation about his own early campaigns, about the importance of Jesse Jackson's ""Rainbow Coalition,"" about how he makes endorsements, about the way in which media treats insurgent candidates-and about the inspiration he has taken from  the Next Left.

Though Sen. Sanders blamed the Democrats' poor performance on the party's abandonment of the working class and defending the status quo, he and Rep. Ocasio-Cortez are assuring Americans they are not lost — a message they're touting on the 'Fighting Oligarchy' tour.  Today, Sen. Sanders sits down with Bret to discuss why the tour is drawing large crowds, why he opposes cuts to healthcare and education, and his concerns with Trump’s tariff policy.

From filibustering for over 25 hours protesting Trump to voting for Trump's son-in-law's father? Yup. That actually happened.President Biden is making headlines but not the ones he wants. Jake Tapper's new book revealed that Biden's team was ready to put him in a wheelchair if he won the 2024 election. This has prompted questions about his mental and physical abilities during his time in the White House. From drama to enthusiasm, we examine the NYC Mayoral Primary. Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani surprised many by fundraising for Council Speaker Adrienne Adams—a move that sparked debate among progressives. Does this help Zohran's campaign? Will Zohran's support for Adrienne Adams hurt Cuomo?And finally, a check-in on America.

Bernie Sanders,"""Bernie Sanders""",1gKGfhkJz8OeToe2wKekwt,Guest: Matt Orfalea - Exposing The Cracks in The Censorship Industrial Complex With Viral Video,"This week on The Free Thought Project Podcast, Jason and Matt sit down with Matt Orfalea, a filmmaker, journalist, and content creator whose story of resilience in the face of censorship is inspiring. Known for his hard-hitting, truth-focused videos, Matt rose to prominence during Bernie Sanders' presidential campaigns, producing viral content that caught the attention of millions. However, his success also made him a target. YouTube and other Big Tech platforms took aim at Matt, censoring his content and attempting to erase his voice from the digital landscape. In this episode, we dissect Matt's journey, from the highs of working with Bernie Sanders to the crushing lows of being de-platformed. We reflect on the Free Thought Project's own battles with censorship, drawing parallels between our experiences. Matt opens up about the mental toll of censorship and how he managed to rebuild his platform and thrive despite the odds.  We also take a deep dive into the Left's dramatic shift over the past decade — from being anti-mega corporation, antiwar, and anti-Big Pharma to now fully supporting these massive industries. This shift has alienated countless Americans, including Matt, who explains how this evolution caused him to reconsider his own political compass and move toward a more independent, principled perspective. We explore how this disenfranchisement is driving many former progressives to question mainstream narratives and align with freedom-oriented movements. Finally, Matt offers his thoughts on fighting Big Tech censorship, the establishment's propaganda machine, and why creators must remain defiant in the face of adversity. His story is a testament to resilience, creativity, and the ongoing battle for free speech in the digital age.

Bernie Sanders,"""Bernie Sanders""",0VPxQhuQ75N61C5S1MFrqr,"An enlightening, frustrating conversation on liberalism (with Adam Gopnik)","“Liberalism is as distinct a tradition as exists in political history, but it suffers from being a practice before it is an ideology, a temperament and a tone and a way of managing the world more than a fixed set of beliefs.” That’s from Adam Gopnik’s new book A Thousand Small Sanities: The Moral Adventure of Liberalism. It is, by turns, a bracing, charming, insightful, irksome defense of the most successful political movement of our age. Liberalism is so successful, in fact, that its achievements are taken for granted while its shortcomings throb through our politics. What caught my eye about Gopnik’s book is his argument that liberalism is a temperament more than an ideology, an approach more than a prescription. As I read his argument, it felt to me that he had identified something essential and often missed in discussions of agendas and plans. But he was also developing a definition of little use in settling the core debates of our age, a liberalism that could be seen as too flexible to mean anything in particular. And so, as liberals do, we argued it out. This conversation has something to thrill and frustrate every listener. In that way, it’s like liberalism itself.
