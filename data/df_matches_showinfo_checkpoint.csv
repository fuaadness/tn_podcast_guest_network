While this is a brand-new romance, we thought it would be interesting to take a look at what might have brought these two together. ¬† Initially we investigate Lupita‚Äôs natal chart and find a compassionate, intuitive Pisces Sun and add in a square from Jupiter in Sagittarius, we see this is one highly educated and internationally identified individual! With a charismatic and independent Venus/Mars in asservtive Aries, she needs independence in relationships and is also a great advocate for encouraging women to be fighters and warriors in their own lives. ¬† Next, we dissect Joshua‚Äôs natal chart and find a prominent Sun/Mercury cazimi in Gemini showing us a jokester with a strong need for information and variety! But, with an opposition from Neptune, this might water down his confidence and create feelings of being lost when it comes to his identity. We also find a caring, nurturing Venus in Cancer and a regimented and performative Saturn, Moon, Mars stellium. ¬† Comparing their charts, we feel conflicted about this couple. On one hand their trine Mercuries provide excellent communication and a mobility style at the same speed. And a Sun/Jupiter trine allows appreciation of each other‚Äôs perspectives. But we also see a Jupiter/Moon square denoting the posssibility of an insincere relationship.

Interview with Harvard MBA turned red carpet jeweler, Zameer Kassam!","Zameer Kassam is the CEO & Chief Designer at Zameer Kassam Fine Jewelry. His family was in the jewelry business and he grew up working in their stores. He got his MBA at Harvard Business School (HBS). He was a business analyst at McKinsey, he was Director of Strategy & Business Development at MTV India and was the Head of Bridal at De Beers in London before founding his own line. I met Zameer because we are both Friends of The Costume Institute at The Metropolitan Museum of Art.¬† ¬†  You‚Äôve done a lot of interesting things in your career and lived in different places. What are the top three things from those experiences that influenced where you are today?¬† 1. Growing up in family jewelry business - would go straight to the shop, learn about diamonds, rubies, gemstones, learn about how clients shop, role you play & value you have in celebrating special moments that people buy jewelry for. Wanted to do something different.¬† 2.Time at HBS - a professor challenged them what would you do if you had all the money in the world? He realized he wanted to design jewelry 3. Time at De Beers Louis Vuitton (joint venture) - learned how LVMH thinks of design & brand building, masterminds of luxury. He got to go to the diamond mines in Botswana, Africa. He felt like a lot of men were proposing with very similar rings. It was a great experience working at De Beers to understand the business side of fine jewelry What steps did you take to start your company? Left his job before his student loans weren't paid. He moved to NY and stayed on his friends couch. A classmate from business school asked him to design an engagement ring for him to propose with. Zameer reached out to his family to understand how to best proceed. Zameer wanted to tell their love story in the ring they designed. He wanted to care for her & protect his wife for the rest of her life, and she is a bit clumsy. She is Columbian, & there is a history of people in her family wearing Columbian emeralds. The friend asked Zameer to create a design where the Columbian emerald is surrounded by Canadian diamonds (like me) that will forever protect her. It was about his love for her and the time he took with Zameer to share the story. The finance was so excited that her fianc√© spent so much time with Zameer although he is so busy. Zameer took a lot of consulting roles, because he didn't have a visa to work in the US. 1. Called friends and asked them to be advisors 2. Everything he has to offer has to be communicated person to person (a lot of word of mouth). Create content to share what the finance did for his finance. (1 hour) 3. Be systematic about the process - have a 3 step process. Step 1: Zameer trains the person on what he thinks is worth it vs. not worth it for stones. 2. Learn the love or family story (1 hour) 3. Share notes, sketches and diamonds, take a deposit and start making the ring. It can happen in less than 3 hours in about 3 weeks instead of someone spending a ton of time walking up & down 5th avenue to try to find a ring How is Zameer Kassam Fine Jewelry different from other jewelry brands? Do you want something that screams the brand name? Do you want something very sparkly that may not be great quality? What is the objective in the piece of jewelry. Zameer's pieces are more special and personal, and each piece is unique. There is a world of people who are classic and timeless, but they want something different. Find a world where it is classic, but in a personal way. You won't get bored of the piece, and it won't look like it was made in the year it was made, but hard to tell because it is timeless.¬† How many people does it take to make one of your rings? 3 people unless something very unique they need expertise for. Usually takes about 3 weeks, but they can rush it. Don't be afraid to look outside your industry for people who can transform your industry. Can be helpful to get anoth",https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Dw3XjIdfKjDsDRrZrusZI,2019-10-16,7i2HYvBR82U2LxX1cgPZKa,The Style That Binds Us podcast,Delia Folk and Alison Bruhn,1761322942.7446597

Ship value, show the process, and let people join the journey‚Äîcredibility compounds in public.- Designing for life: Pick the game you want to play‚ÄîKeith optimizes for sanity and cash flow, not a $100M exit.

Brad Smith,"""Brad Smith""",6tHWTGZuRqUDvqiX31lc5P,Brad Smith (Microsoft): 'Amerikaanse rode knop-scenario voor Europa moeten we zo voorkomen',"Hoe wordt onze digitale infrastructuur eigenlijk beschermd met Donald Trump in het Witte Huis? En welke garanties kan een Amerikaanse techreus ons geven, om te voorkomen dat we de toegang tot servers √©n onze data verliezen met een druk op de spreekwoordelijke rode knop? Die prangende vragen krijgt Brad Smith, vicevoorzitter en president van Microsoft, tijdens dit interview door Ben van der Burg en Joe van Burik in deze aflevering van De Grote Tech Show. Bekijk dit (video)interview met Nederlandse ondertiteling op het YouTube-kanaal van BNR Nieuwsradio. Met dank aan Najib Tarahbi (video), Osama Aguilla (video), Rosanne Peters (ondertiteling), Donner Bakker (redactie), A√§ron Loupatty (online) en Yannick Eling (chef redactie). Europa is sterk afhankelijk van Microsoft, Nvidia en andere Amerikaanse techbedrijven voor onze digitale communicatie en infrastructuur. De zorgen dat met √©√©n druk op de knop toegang tot computersystemen verdwijnt of onze gegevens worden doorgelicht door de Amerikaanse overheid, waren hier nog nooit zo groot, gezien de grillen van de Amerikaanse president Donald Trump. In dit gesprek toont Smith begrip voor die bezorgdheid √©n draagt hij oplossingen aan. Zo moeten de Europese Unie en de Verenigde Staten volgens hem samen gauw aan afspraken werken over de toegang tot (Europese) gegevens die opgeslagen worden door Amerikaanse techbedrijven.

Wat betekenen de nieuwste AI-modellen voor werk en creativiteit? Hoe blijven Europese startups concurreren met het nog altijd machtige Silicon Valley en het ondoorzichtige China? Dit zijn geen oppervlakkige interviews, maar diepgaande gesprekken waarin we de hoofdrolspelers spreken die √©cht impact maken. De technologische revolutie is in volle gang en be√Ønvloedt elk aspect van ons leven‚Äîvan de manier waarop we werken en communiceren tot de geopolitieke machtsverhoudingen. Daarom brengen we niet alleen de technologische kant in beeld, maar ook de economische en maatschappelijke implicaties ervan. Naast de grote innovaties kijken we naar de bedrijven die deze ontwikkelingen vormgeven. Wat is de strategie van big tech-bedrijven zoals Google, Apple, Microsoft en Meta? Hoe verandert de concurrentiestrijd tussen Nvidia, AMD en Intel de chipmarkt? Wat betekenen nieuwe wetten en regels in Europa en de VS voor de toekomst van technologie? AnalysesDaarnaast hoor je bij De Grote Tech Show, exclusief als extra podcast elke week, hoe Joe van Burik en Ben van der Burg de week in tech doornemen. Ze analyseren het laatste nieuws, plaatsen de ontwikkelingen in perspectief en geven scherpe inzichten over wat er √©cht speelt.

And since Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine two years ago, the Biden administration has wielded them in a number of innovative ways. At the same time, some of these uses have also triggered concerns about U.S. overreach, something that could have consequences for both U.S. national security and the health of the U.S. economy.¬†To better understand how the U.S. government is approaching its financial sanctions policies today, Lawfare Senior Editor Scott R.

Brad Smith,"""Brad Smith""",1GBKYjR7TtD9Txk6Dbb0sE,#009 Brad Smith and Braaap Motorcycles,"Brad Smith - Brad is founder and CEO of Braaap Motorcycles. His entrepreneurial spirit was revealed at a young age when he started Braaap from a backyard shed in his early teens. He imported his first 10 motorcycles at 16, and then lost all his money. Most people would have given up, but not this guy. He saved his money, then travelled overseas where he met with manufacturers face to face, with the goal of finding a manufacturing partner who could produce the bike he had designed. After being laughed out of more than 50 factories Brad finally found a manufacturer who believed in him and his vision. And that turned his dream into reality to become what we know today as Braaap Motorcycles. Occasionally we get to meet someone who really leaves an impression. And that is exactly what happened here when George met Brad and had the chance to chat with him about his life with Braaap Motorcycles.¬† ABOUT BRAAAP MOTORCYCLES Braaap is an Australian motorcycle company that was founded in Tasmania in 2005. The Braaap story is very cool as they are a family business that is very clearly shaking up the motorcycle industry. At Braaap (pronounced brarp), they design and develop their own motorcycles. R&D is also completed locally utilising Australian engineering standards. They produce and assemble the motorcycles themselves, and use ‚ÄúAustralian Engineering and global manufacturing efficiencies to produce a world class motorcycle that is backed by a Lifetime Warranty.‚Äù Definitely worth a visit to their web site at - https://braaapmotorcycles.com¬† PODCAST SPONSORS This podcast would not be possible without the support of The Bike Stig YouTube Channel - https://www.youtube.com/c/thebikestig PRODUCTS WE USE AND SUPPORT Metzeler Tyres - https://www.metzeler.com/en-au/home¬† California Superbike School Australia - https://www.superbikeschool.com.au/css SC Project Exhausts - https://sc-project.com.au K-Tech Suspension Australia - https://www.ktechaustralia.com AUDIO The music on this podcast is used under license from Artlist - License Number 490757.

Title: Tools and Weapons: The Promise and the Peril of the Digital Age Author: Carol Ann Browne, Brad Smith Narrator: Carol Ann Browne, Brad Smith Format: Unabridged Audiobook Length: 11 hours 12 minutes Release date: September 10, 2019 Ratings: Ratings of Book: 4.83 of Total 6   Ratings of Narrator: 5 of Total 1 Genres: Management & Leadership Publisher's Summary:      The instant New York Times bestseller. From Microsoft's president and one of the tech industry's broadest thinkers, a frank and thoughtful reckoning with how to balance enormous promise and existential risk as the digitization of everything accelerates. ‚ÄúA colorful and insightful insiders‚Äô view of how technology is both empowering and threatening us. From privacy to cyberattacks, this timely book is a useful guide for how to navigate the digital future.‚Äù¬†‚ÄîWalter Isaacson Microsoft President Brad Smith operates by a simple core belief: When your technology changes the world, you bear a responsibility to help address the world you have helped create. This might seem uncontroversial, but it flies in the face of a tech sector long obsessed with rapid growth and sometimes on disruption as an end in itself. While sweeping digital transformation holds great promise, we have reached an inflection point. The world has turned information technology into both a powerful tool and a formidable weapon, and new approaches are needed to manage an era defined by even more powerful inventions like artificial intelligence. Companies that create technology must accept greater responsibility for the future, and governments will need to regulate technology by moving faster and catching up with the pace of innovation. In Tools and Weapons, Brad Smith and Carol Ann Browne bring us a captivating narrative from the cockpit of one of the world's largest and most powerful tech companies as it finds itself in the middle of some of the thorniest emerging issues of our time. These are challenges that come with no preexisting playbook, including privacy, cybercrime and cyberwar, social media, the moral conundrums of artificial intelligence, big tech's relationship to inequality, and the challenges for democracy, far and near. While in no way a self-glorifying 'Microsoft memoir,' the book pulls back the curtain remarkably wide onto some of the company's most crucial recent decision points as it strives to protect the hopes technology offers against the very real threats it also presents. There are huge ramifications for communities and countries, and Brad Smith provides a thoughtful and urgent contribution to that effort.",https://open.spotify.com/episode/320F9vyEfQ4zP9QC3YaD3E,2019-09-10,6ctrDAKpzmM9V7MKSOKhda,Tune In To: This Breakthrough Full Audiobook For Thriller Fans.,thebookvoice.com,1761322962.9918976

In this week‚Äôs special Business Live show, Brad and I sat down with Clint Fiore, founder of Dealonomy, to unpack one of the most innovative shifts happening in the business brokerage world right now.After a decade of helping entrepreneurs buy and sell companies, Clint decided to flip the model on its head. Instead of catering to sellers like every traditional brokerage, Dealonomy is designed to be the most buyer-friendly platform on the planet. Think of it as a curated, high-quality marketplace ‚Äî no more messy listings, ghost brokers, or bait-and-switch deals.Clint breaks down how he raised $3 million, built a tech-driven team, and created a system that makes buying and selling businesses faster, smoother, and more transparent ‚Äî all while keeping relationships at the center of the process. We talk about what buyers get wrong, how to stand out as a great buyer, and why empathy, patience, and listening skills are still the ultimate deal-closing tools.This one‚Äôs for entrepreneurs, dealmakers, and searchers who are tired of the old-school M&A grind and ready to see how technology and heart can actually work together to change the game.Key Highlights:- How Clint flipped the traditional brokerage model ‚Äî from sell-side to buy-side focused.- The $3M raise that built Dealonomy, and how he assembled an all-star investor and advisory team.- Why most business marketplaces fail ‚Äî and how Dealonomy vets only ‚Äúgood deals for good people.‚Äù- The platform‚Äôs AI-powered financial analysis that streamlines valuations and offers real-time insights.- The ‚Äúfreemium‚Äù membership model that aligns incentives with serious buyers.- How buyers can stand out by leading with empathy, clarity, and strong communication.- Why relationship skills are becoming more important than ever in a high-tech world.- The long-term vision: becoming the trusted, quality-first platform people think of before BizBuySell.If you‚Äôre serious about buying or selling a business, or just curious where the future of small business acquisitions is headed, check out Dealonomy.com and connect with Clint on X and LinkedIn.And if you enjoyed this live breakdown, share it with someone who‚Äôs in the deal game ‚Äî it might just change how they look at buying and selling forever.üëâ Stop playing small, book a call!

Including examples is also helpful. He also shared a simple tip: Voice Memos.

Start with Small Goals: Brad emphasises setting small, achievable goals when beginning your running journey. It‚Äôs important not to aim too high initially, such as trying to run a marathon in your first week. 2. Consistency is Key: He advises being consistent with your training. Regular runs, even if they are short, help build endurance and make running a habit. 3. Find What Works for You: Brad highlights the importance of finding a training routine that fits your lifestyle and personal preferences. Everyone is different, so what works for one person might not work for another. 4. Listen to Your Body: Paying attention to how your body feels during and after runs is crucial. It‚Äôs important to push yourself, but not to the point of injury. 5. Incorporate Variety: Including different types of runs, like sprints and hill training, can improve your overall running performance and keep your training interesting. 6. Use Mantras: Brad suggests using mantras or positive affirmations to stay motivated during tough runs. This mental trick can help you push through difficult parts of your training. 7. Embrace the Community: He talks about the benefits of joining a running community or club. Running with others can provide motivation, support, and a sense of camaraderie. 8. Acknowledge Pain and Growth: Understand that some discomfort is part of the growth process. Recognise when pain is a signal to slow down and when it‚Äôs a natural part of building strength and endurance. 9. Set Multiple Goals: Brad recommends having A, B, and C goals for races. Your ‚ÄúA‚Äù goal is your ideal outcome, ‚ÄúB‚Äù is a solid achievement, and ‚ÄúC‚Äù is the minimum you aim for. This approach helps you stay motivated and adaptable. 10. Focus on Enjoyment: Above all, Brad stresses the importance of enjoying the running journey. The process should be fulfilling and fun, not just about hitting milestones. **A couple of BIG favours:  1) please like and review this podcast so more people will discover it :) 2) come on the podcast and talk about your running journey and/or refer someone you‚Äôd love me to interview (whether you know them or not :) )¬† Lets not keep the power of running a secret any more!¬† Hit me up on Facebook/Instagram (FitMIND FitBODY) or send me an email - Michelle @ FitMINDFitBODY .co¬† Don't miss an episode of the FitMind FitBODY Podcast.

Gabriel Iglesias,"""Gabriel Iglesias""",32hBM3v0dkclDUMNuDtx8s,Gabriel Iglesias walks out on Pauly Shore's podcast in Las Vegas I The PMS Podcast Show #57,"In a city known for its surprises, this episode of The PMS Podcast Show takes it to another level. Pauly Shore, the MTV wild child turned podcast ringleader, brings his offbeat talk show to Las Vegas, and things get out of hand fast. Comedian Gabriel Iglesias‚Äîbetter known as ""Fluffy""‚Äîis front and center, but when a conversation turns sideways, he does the unthinkable: he walks out, leaving the room in stunned silence and adding another unpredictable chapter to Pauly‚Äôs book of outrageous moments.But this episode isn‚Äôt just about Fluffy‚Äôs dramatic exit. Pauly has assembled a cast that reads like a Vegas fever dream: Piff The Magic Dragon, the deadpan magician who brought a dragon suit to the Las Vegas strip and somehow made it work; Mini Kiss, the pint-sized tribute act delivering arena-level energy on a much smaller scale; Kina Doll and the Micro Mania Wrestlers, bringing their own brand of unpredictable, body-slamming entertainment; plus appearances by Michael Richter, X Country Dancers, and Nicole Tran, rounding out the night with a mix of comedy, dance, and pure Vegas eccentricity.The PMS Podcast Show is Pauly Shore at his most unfiltered‚Äîa throwback to his MTV days, but now with a podcast twist. Alongside co-host Nicole Tran, producer Graig Agop, and bartender/chaos catalyst Ryan Mirvis, Pauly dives into off-the-cuff conversations that flip from hilarious to downright bizarre in a heartbeat. With the house band, The Busters, jamming in the background and Pauly‚Äôs Dollys adding a splash of burlesque, each episode is a high-wire act of comedy and chaos, with Pauly always ready to push things a little further.If you're into raw, unvarnished moments where comedy, drama, and pure WTF collide, this episode has it all. Gabriel Iglesias‚Äô unexpected walkout is just the tip of the iceberg in a show that‚Äôs as unpredictable as Vegas itself. It's the kind of episode that reminds you why Pauly Shore, for all his quirks, is still a master of creating must-watch moments. Whether you're a die-hard fan or just tuning in for the spectacle, The PMS Podcast Show never disappoints. Learn more about your ad choices.

Gabriel Iglesias,"""Gabriel Iglesias""",5jPxl1yQmBxQnbqBaoWXIY,Gabriel Iglesias,"When you think of adjectives starting with 'f' that describe comedians you might think of ""funny,"" ""fast,"" and ""fierce"" -- but you may not think of ""fluffy"" -- not unless you are fans of Gabriel Iglesias who has ridden family-friendly and playful comedy to the top of the business. Always rotund, Gabriel was nicknamed ""fluffy"" by his mom -- we hope she gets a cut because it has become his trademark. From an early spot on the Nickelodeon kids show All That to a turn at Last Comic Standing Gabe kept climbing the career ladder. Along the way he also starred in a popular sitcom and has developed a fine resume of voice acting work. But Gabriel has never wandered far from the stand-up stage, hosting a Comedy Central Stand Up series and starring in numerous specials of his own. And to put the cherry on top, in 2022 Gabriel became the first comic to sell out a show at Dodger Stadium -- not bad for a kid called ""fluffy""! As always find extended cuts below and thanks for sharing our shows! Want more Fluffy? Fluffy has turned out to be a great, if unusual, nickname for Gabe and her he tells Jimmy Fallon the origin story. https://www.tiktok.com/@fallont.../video/7476524565150223662 When Gabe was on Last Comic Standing he was disqualified for using a cellphone to talk with family. Always a standup he turned that setback into instant material for his next special. https://youtu.be/A0BsqoMndz8?si=R5HM2qAt2zSwh3h7 From 2019-21 Gabe starred in a fun sitcom -- Mr. Iglesias -- which starred him as a high school history teacher. Here's the first episode. https://youtu.be/qGIPoodveZM?si=j2Y0jE03pYK7ffaV Gabe continues to be a top standup draw and his latest Netflix special -- 2025's Legend of Fluffy -- shows him in top form. https://youtu.be/ybzJy_jdJgA?si=iBS9ZUo6Zdtcb7Lf",https://open.spotify.com/episode/5jPxl1yQmBxQnbqBaoWXIY,2025-07-08,42rEES6angm0venwHsyP3i,Laugh Tracks Legends of Comedy with Randy and Steve,Randy Hodgins and Steve McLellan,1761322977.1425607

Idris Elba,"""Idris Elba""",5QNmYuU7Her1x7QFJteIUD,Idris Elba's Most Powerful Performances A Tribute to His Acting Legacy,"Idris Elba is a name synonymous with versatility, intensity, and undeniable charisma. Over the years, he has solidified his place as one of the most talented actors in Hollywood, with a career spanning film, television, and stage. Whether he's playing a troubled antihero, a heroic leader, or a complex villain, Elba's performances have always left an indelible mark on audiences. This tribute to his acting legacy will explore some of his most powerful roles and how they‚Äôve contributed to his status as one of the most respected actors of his generation.Stringer Bell in ""The Wire""One of Elba's breakthrough roles was his portrayal of Russell ""Stringer"" Bell in HBO's critically acclaimed series The Wire. As the drug kingpin of Baltimore, Stringer Bell was a character that combined ruthless ambition with a surprising intellect. Elba's nuanced performance brought depth to a character that could easily have been a mere stereotype of a gangster. Stringer Bell‚Äôs inner conflict between wanting to run a legitimate business and being trapped in the violent world of drug dealing showcased Elba‚Äôs range. His ability to convey vulnerability while maintaining the character's formidable presence made Stringer Bell one of television's most compelling figures. Elba‚Äôs portrayal of this complex character earned him widespread recognition and set the stage for his future roles in Hollywood.Nelson Mandela in ""Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom""In 2013, Elba took on the monumental task of portraying the late Nelson Mandela in Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. This performance was nothing short of extraordinary. Elba‚Äôs transformation into the South African leader, both physically and emotionally, was mesmerizing. He captured Mandela‚Äôs humility, resolve, and unyielding commitment to justice with grace. The film chronicled Mandela‚Äôs life from his early years to his presidency, and Elba‚Äôs portrayal earned him several award nominations, including a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor. His dedication to embodying the iconic figure, coupled with his emotional depth, cemented Elba's place as one of the most powerful actors of his generation.Heimdall in the Marvel Cinematic UniverseIn addition to his dramatic roles, Elba has proven himself a formidable presence in blockbuster films, notably as Heimdall in the Thor series within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Elba‚Äôs portrayal of Heimdall, the all-seeing, all-hearing guardian of the Bifrost, stood out for its quiet strength and wisdom. Despite being part of an ensemble cast, Elba‚Äôs portrayal of Heimdall brought a sense of gravitas to the MCU that was often subtle but deeply impactful. His role in Thor: Ragnarok added emotional weight, as Heimdall is shown defying orders to help the people of Asgard. Elba‚Äôs performance in these films exemplifies his ability to balance the fantastical with deeply human elements, ensuring that Heimdall became a fan-favorite character.Idris Elba‚Äôs career is a testament to his immense talent, dedication, and versatility. From gritty crime dramas to fantastical superhero sagas, he continues to captivate audiences with every performance. As fans continue to celebrate his legacy, the demand for Idris Elba merchandise reflects the admiration and respect he has earned in the entertainment industry. Whether through his unforgettable roles or his larger-than-life presence, Idris Elba will undoubtedly remain an enduring figure in both film and popular culture for years to come.Hosted by Ausha.

Idris Elba,"""Idris Elba""",5B6FA4w1PIRdHllYDBjRlV,Celebrate the Multifaceted Magic of September 6th: From Magellan's Voyage to Idris Elba's Birthday,"Ah, September 6th‚Äîwhat a subtly spicy corner of the calendar. Not quite the end of summer, not quite pumpkin-spice-everything season. It‚Äôs like the Wednesday of months. But hold onto your coffee, because even a middle-of-the-road month can sneak in a surprise or two.Let‚Äôs start with some historical glitter. On this day in 1522, a salty ship by the name of the Victoria, part of Ferdinand Magellan‚Äôs once five-strong squadron, limped back into Spain with just 18 very tired sailors. And by tired, I mean ""we circumnavigated the planet and haven‚Äôt had a decent bath in three years"" tired. This was humanity‚Äôs first recorded trip all the way around the globe. That tiny wooden tub pulled off the GPS-less, no-Google-Maps miracle and launched an era of, well, a lot of maps and a fair bit of colonialism. But still‚Äîimpressive seafaring, lads.And if we fast-forward a few centuries and shift gears wildly to the realm of sparkling pop culture, today also happens to be the birthday of the one and only Idris Elba. Cue the collective swoon. Yes, on this day in 1972, the world was graced with a man who can act, DJ, produce, direct, and somehow manage to make even a wool overcoat look like high art. Whether he‚Äôs Heimdall in the Marvel universe or turning heads as the impossibly cool Stringer Bell in ""The Wire,"" Idris brings a kind of magnetic intensity that makes you wonder if charisma can be inherited like eye color. Happy birthday, Mr. Elba! If you‚Äôre listening‚Äîand you‚Äôre absolutely not‚Äîbut if by some twist of fate you are, we‚Äôd all like to thank you for making our televisions, and daydreams, significantly more watchable.Speaking of stars aligning, September 6 also gave us a curious planetary tidbit: the Voyager 1 spacecraft, launched just days earlier in 1977, started snapping its first photos of Jupiter on this exact day. Imagine: humanity‚Äôs long-distance love letter to the cosmos, taking baby steps into the universe. You‚Äôve got space, sea voyages, and sexy leading men‚Ä¶this day really covers all the bases. All we‚Äôre missing now is cake.So whether you‚Äôre celebrating today with a birthday toast, a bit of interstellar curiosity, or just honoring old sailing ships that really went through it, know this‚ÄîSeptember 6th is not just humming in the background. It‚Äôs a legit contender in the ""Strangely Big Deal"" category.And to all the Virgo babies born today, take a final bow too. You're in good company. Whether you're plotting your next move with tactical precision or just reorganizing your spice rack alphabetically for the ninth time, this day has your energy literally woven into history.Now go forth, celebrate smartly, and remember: even on a random Wednesday in the calendar of life, the universe might just decide to do something wild.

Januar 2014 Laufl√§nge: 146 Minuten Im Verleih von Senator Filmverleih  ""MANDELA: Der lange Weg zur Freiheit"" | Trailer Check & Infos Deutsch German [HD] mit Idris Elba, Naomie Harris, Mark Elderkin  Bildgewaltig wird die zutiefst pers√∂nliche Geschichte eines Mannes portr√§tiert, der sich konsequent allen Widerst√§nden entgegen stellt, um f√ºr ein besseres Leben in seinem Heimatland zu k√§mpfen. Noch w√§hrend seiner 27-j√§hrigen Haftstrafe auf der ber√ºchtigten Gef√§ngnisinsel Robben Island stieg Nelson Mandela zum charismatischen F√ºhrer der Anti-Apartheid-Bewegung auf und zum weltweiten Symbol f√ºr friedlichen Widerstand. MANDELA - DER LANGE WEG ZUR FREIHEIT beschreibt die Entstehung einer modernen Ikone, die die Aufhebung der Rassentrennung und damit eine langersehnte politische Wende in S√ºdafrika herbeif√ºhrte und ist gleichzeitig eine Liebeserkl√§rung an einen Menschen, der durch seinen unerm√ºdlichen Kampf f√ºr Freiheit, Gleichheit und Unabh√§ngigkeit die ganze Welt ver√§ndert hat.

It‚Äôs pretty clear it‚Äôs flat, so do they have #round truthers? Does it flip around like a pancake in space to allow for day and night? It‚Äôs interesting that the atmosphere is so thin but allow for a lovely bright day in town and a starry, nebulae-filled night when you ride out on the rainbow bridge.Why does the group stop so far from their destination?Perhaps it‚Äôs because of the imposing figure standing at the end of the rainbow bridge. It‚Äôs Heimdall!We get to meet the stoic character who guards the rainbow bridge. We also talk about Idris Elba, one of our faves, who plays him, even though it sounds like he didn‚Äôt enjoy his experience. He doesn‚Äôt get to do much, after all. Plus he had to wear those contacts and that insanely large costume.Heimdall comes from the Norse myths and a lot of his descriptions fit what they did with him. Even the references to him in the deleted scenes last week made by the Warriors Three fit the myths. But we‚Äôre really glad they went with Elba instead of someone white considering the mythical character is said to have the whitest skin of them all.Loki tries to show his smooth-talking charm to get them past Heimdall. Turns out, Heimdall already knows where they‚Äôre going. Is this perhaps a moment where Loki is delaying a bit in the hopes that Odin stops them from traveling to Jotunheim?Thor interrupts Loki and demands that Heimdall let them pass. But why is he seemingly so angry? Is it just that Heimdall is delaying his confrontation with the frost giants?Heimdall seems to refuse Thor‚Äôs request, but it turns out he was just adding a dramatic pause. We don‚Äôt think Heimdall was playing with Thor. Heimdall doesn‚Äôt seem like the sort who plays those games. He likely was actually making a dramatic pause because he‚Äôs so pissed at the frost giants.But he does say the frost giants have never made it past him before so perhaps this is their chance to get his help?Idris Elba brings a lot of stoic weight to the minute as we finally meet Heimdall.

Idris Elba,"""Idris Elba""",6sGU6a3OSbMmdJ8kKj0DEw,Sabrina Elba on creating S‚Äôable Labs with husband Idris Elba: 'We never wanted this to be about us.',"When Idris and Sabrina Elba, husband and wife, launched their gender-neutral skin-care brand, S‚Äôable Labs, in July 2022, it was just ahead of the boom in celebrity beauty launches. The brand had been in development for over a year, born during the height of the Covid-19 era. The impetus was an Instagram Live series the couple started together called ""Together Tuesdays,"" in which they talked about couples. The idea of S‚Äôable Labs is that skin care is genderless and something that couples can share. Growing up in Vancouver, Canada and experiencing acne as a teenager, Sabrina Elba became a beauty aficionado from an early period. But the co-founder of S‚Äôable Labs said she also struggled as the only Black person in high school and felt the lack of representation in beauty, too. ‚ÄúMy relationship with beauty early on felt a lot like an investment on my part into brands that weren't investing in me,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI had a complete misunderstanding about how to care for melanated skin. But it wasn't only because I wasn't surrounded by people who looked like me, but it was also because the beauty industry didn't cater to people who looked like me.‚Äù As her relationship and eventual marriage to Idris Elba blossomed, Sabrina was exposed to a more entrepreneurial culture and mindset, which eventually translated into S‚Äôable Labs. Today, the brand is just over 1 year old and sells five products ranging from $28-$50 through its e-commerce site and SpaceNK. Zooming in from Camden, London, joined the Glossy Beauty Podcast to discuss how the Instagram Live series inspired the brand, what it‚Äôs like operating a celebrity brand and what it means to be a melanin-inclusive brand.",https://open.spotify.com/episode/6sGU6a3OSbMmdJ8kKj0DEw,2023-09-21,3bXgxuiHzIRKqfoRRXn0hP,The Glossy Beauty Podcast,Glossy,1761322987.1309884

Six others were injured. The alleged shooter, a 15-year-old girl, was also found dead. White House National Security Adviser John Kirby discusses on ""CBS Mornings"" the latest about the mysterious drones now reported in at least six states and what the federal government knows. Congress is expected this week to vote on billions of dollars of aid for communities damaged by hurricanes and floods earlier this year. The Small Business Administration warned in October that the fund for emergency federal loans was depleted and the Biden administration formally requested nearly $100 billion. However, both parties agreed to leave Washington ahead of Election Day without approving new money. Many Americans could soon see a change in their Social Security benefits. As early as Tuesday, the Senate could vote on a bipartisan bill that would repeal certain benefit reductions for millions of retirees and their spouses. CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger explains. Food safety advocates have pushed for decades to outlaw Red No. 3, an artificial dye linked to potential cancer risks. California will be the first state to restrict its use in foods starting in 2027. CBS News medical contributor Dr. Celine Gounder weighs in. The highly anticipated ""Sonic the Hedgehog 3"" hits theaters this Friday, introducing a fierce new enemy, Shadow. Six-time Emmy nominee Idris Elba reprises his role as Knuckles and shares how he got back up to speed for the action-packed sequel. The New York Times called comedian Nikki Glaser ""comedian of the year"" for her knockout HBO special, ""Someday You'll Die."" It received Emmy, Grammy and Golden Globe nominations.

Idris Elba,"""Idris Elba""",2IlVUJ24uEydQgZZ5X8Mkl,The Reckoning: Kwame Kwei-Armah and Idris Elba on the Arts and Black Lives Matter,"A great reckoning is taking place in the wake of the brutal killing of George Floyd and the protests that followed his death. Companies and organisations are looking afresh at how they can do a better job of combatting institutional bias and racism. Employees are increasingly speaking out about their experiences and calling for change.  In this special event recorded on Thursday June 25 2020, Intelligence Squared brought together two leading voices from the arts, Kwame Kwei-Armah, artistic director of the Young Vic, and Idris Elba, star of The Wire and Luther, to discuss what should happen and is likely to happen in the world of culture as we move forward. Given all the promises made and broken over the years, will things be different this time? Will there be deep structural change so that we see more Black and Brown people ‚Äì not just on the stage or screen ‚Äì but in positions of real power and decision-making? And once lessons have been learned, what do people actually need to do?  Our chair for the evening was writer and broadcaster Yassmin Abdel-Magied. ‚Äî We‚Äôd love to hear your feedback and what you think we should talk about next, who we should have on and what our future debates should be.¬† Send us an email or voice note with your thoughts to podcasts@intelligencesquared.com or Tweet us @intelligence2.¬† And if you‚Äôd like to support our mission to foster honest debate and compelling conversations, as well as ad-free podcasts, exclusive bonus content, early access and much more, become a supporter of Intelligence Squared today.

After a recent interview with Closer Weekly, the former Fresh Prince of Bel-Air actor shared that his acting career had stalled after famously playing Carlton Banks.

Then, somebody suggested on social media that he work with Tyler Perry to restart his career. At which point, the television host and occasional actor shoot off the comment, ""I don't need or ever want that man to do anything for me."" Okay, well you see that's because Alfonso is doing quite fine, thank you. As host of America's Funniest Videos and Dancing with the Stars, I don't think he needs any Tyler Perry money or drama.

Companies and organisations are looking afresh at how they can do a better job of combatting institutional bias and racism. Employees are increasingly speaking out about their experiences and calling for change.  In this special event recorded on Thursday June 25 2020, Intelligence Squared brought together two leading voices from the arts, Kwame Kwei-Armah, artistic director of the Young Vic, and Idris Elba, star of The Wire and Luther, to discuss what should happen and is likely to happen in the world of culture as we move forward. Given all the promises made and broken over the years, will things be different this time? Will there be deep structural change so that we see more Black and Brown people ‚Äì not just on the stage or screen ‚Äì but in positions of real power and decision-making? And once lessons have been learned, what do people actually need to do?

Moral to the Story: You can use these questions to develop a foundation regardless of relationship. Other Fun Topics Discussed: Get to Know Us: Have you used scents to try an attract people? Perfumes are bad for you. Tamu loved original Dolce & Gabanna Scent trails - that time on the jetway when someone farted. Chemical smells gives Mallory a migraine. #WePodcastLikeThis The Key to 36 Questions: Be open-minded. 4 minutes of looking into someone's eyes in silence it too much for Tamu. For our true crime friends: you may be able to detect sociopathy and psychopathy with these questions. These questions can be a good way to gauge someone's open-mindedness. There is a potential for us to to make compromises even with these questions because we see what we want to see. Tamu wonders if these questions would have worked with Wights 1 and 2 and determines, probably not. Follow your intuition. It is OK to be alone. Make good climatic choices. Try these 36 questions on a speed date.

Idris Elba,"""Idris Elba""",1MRlxleaFbvpmadr65nt6s, Idris Elba Sparks Backlash Over 'Black Actor' Label,"Idris Elba, the actor known for his roles in ""Luther"" and ""The Wire,"" has caused a social media uproar with his comments on being labeled a 'black actor'. In an interview with Esquire, the 50-year-old actor expressed his opinion that the label puts him in a 'box' and that an 'obsession' with race can hinder aspirations and growth.  Elba's controversial comments received criticism from fans, who accused him of 'denying his blackness'. However, in a new interview with The Guardian, the actor doubled down on his remarks and slammed his critics. He stated that it's his prerogative not to like being called a black actor and that fans who accuse him of 'denying his blackness' are just being stupid.  Elba also clarified that his choice to become an actor was not due to the lack of diversity in the industry. He believes that being an actor is a profession, just like being an architect, and that it should not be defined by race. While he acknowledges that racism is real, he believes that it is only as powerful as one allows it to be.  Despite the backlash, Elba made it clear on Twitter that he is a proud black man. He wants to be recognized for his achievements as an actor, rather than being labeled by his race.  Elba's comments have sparked a larger conversation on the issue of labeling actors based on their race. While some believe that acknowledging an actor's race is important for representation and diversity, others argue that it can hinder an actor's career growth and limit their opportunities.  What are your thoughts on this issue? Do you think labeling actors based on their race is necessary for representation, or do you believe it can be limiting and hinder their career growth?

With James Gunn on board and the DC Extended Universe looking to move forward and continue their string of critical and commercial hit movies, the news today is even more exciting. Will Smith is out as Deadshot, which would be a shame - except he‚Äôs being replaced with Idris Elba, which immediately raises the excitement level for the Suicide Squad. They deserve a second chance, just as James Gunn does - and there‚Äôs a lot of real great story to be mined from the source material. With Gunn directing, Margot Robbie returning as Harley Quinn, and Elba brining his amazing acting chops to the table as Deadshot, this movie could redeem the Squad, the DCEU, and potentially be one of the best comic movies of the next decade.

It‚Äôs pretty clear it‚Äôs flat, so do they have #round truthers? Does it flip around like a pancake in space to allow for day and night? It‚Äôs interesting that the atmosphere is so thin but allow for a lovely bright day in town and a starry, nebulae-filled night when you ride out on the rainbow bridge.Why does the group stop so far from their destination?Perhaps it‚Äôs because of the imposing figure standing at the end of the rainbow bridge. It‚Äôs Heimdall!We get to meet the stoic character who guards the rainbow bridge. We also talk about Idris Elba, one of our faves, who plays him, even though it sounds like he didn‚Äôt enjoy his experience. He doesn‚Äôt get to do much, after all. Plus he had to wear those contacts and that insanely large costume.Heimdall comes from the Norse myths and a lot of his descriptions fit what they did with him. Even the references to him in the deleted scenes last week made by the Warriors Three fit the myths. But we‚Äôre really glad they went with Elba instead of someone white considering the mythical character is said to have the whitest skin of them all.Loki tries to show his smooth-talking charm to get them past Heimdall. Turns out, Heimdall already knows where they‚Äôre going. Is this perhaps a moment where Loki is delaying a bit in the hopes that Odin stops them from traveling to Jotunheim?Thor interrupts Loki and demands that Heimdall let them pass. But why is he seemingly so angry? Is it just that Heimdall is delaying his confrontation with the frost giants?Heimdall seems to refuse Thor‚Äôs request, but it turns out he was just adding a dramatic pause. We don‚Äôt think Heimdall was playing with Thor. Heimdall doesn‚Äôt seem like the sort who plays those games. He likely was actually making a dramatic pause because he‚Äôs so pissed at the frost giants.But he does say the frost giants have never made it past him before so perhaps this is their chance to get his help?Idris Elba brings a lot of stoic weight to the minute as we finally meet Heimdall.

Noch w√§hrend seiner 27-j√§hrigen Haftstrafe auf der ber√ºchtigten Gef√§ngnisinsel Robben Island stieg Nelson Mandela zum charismatischen F√ºhrer der Anti-Apartheid-Bewegung auf und zum weltweiten Symbol f√ºr friedlichen Widerstand. MANDELA - DER LANGE WEG ZUR FREIHEIT beschreibt die Entstehung einer modernen Ikone, die die Aufhebung der Rassentrennung und damit eine langersehnte politische Wende in S√ºdafrika herbeif√ºhrte und ist gleichzeitig eine Liebeserkl√§rung an einen Menschen, der durch seinen unerm√ºdlichen Kampf f√ºr Freiheit, Gleichheit und Unabh√§ngigkeit die ganze Welt ver√§ndert hat.

Bryan Johnson has come to the pod.You have likely heard an interview with Johnson before, since he‚Äôs become such an object of love, hate and fascination among the media over the past couple of years. That said, you will not have heard an interview like this with Johnson.I was covering Johnson‚Äôs exploits in the brain-computer-interface and health fields in-depth before anyone else. Back then, my editors and others often seemed to think too much ink was being spilled on the man. But, in January of 2023, I wrote the story that turned Johnson into an overnight sensation, and, well, people just could not get enough Johnson after that.Alongside the director Chris Smith, I also made the film Don‚Äôt Die on Johnson and his longevity pursuits for Netflix.Over the course of reporting on Johnson for so long and doing the film, I‚Äôve gotten to know our world-famous vampire quite well. So, we tried to go in some more personal directions - erections, cults, smoking toads - with this interview and to chart Johnson‚Äôs evolution from someone Silicon Valley shunned to resident longevity guru and blossoming cult leader for some futuristic religion. Johnson also speaks at length for the first time about his decision to pull away from the Blueprint business and his struggles to figure out what‚Äôs next for his Don‚Äôt Die movement.Enjoy!The Core Memory podcast is sponsored by Brex, the intelligent finance platform.

Bryan Johnson,"""Bryan Johnson""",3Jv8NalpaRPWeL34CYzDl8,240: Bryan Johnson‚Äôs Impossible Blueprint,"In January, 2023, Bloomberg published an article about how tech entrepreneur turned longevity stan, Bryan Johnson, spends $2 million a year in an attempt to live forever‚Äîor at least until age 200, as the goalposts shift. Then a Netflix documentary, Don‚Äôt Die: The Man Who Wants to Live Forever, dropped on January 1, taking a deep dive into Johnson‚Äôs quest and complex personal life. A strange thing happened along the way: Johnson felt much more personable and relatable than ever before to many viewers. Given the Bloomberg journalist is one of the producers, is this the latest propaganda piece by a supplements-pushing huckster, or is Johnson tapping into something much older and deeper about the human condition?

In doing so, he is reframing the zeitgeist and revolting against our culture of self-destructive behaviors. Centered on Project Blueprint and the ambition to halt and potentially reverse biological aging, he challenges cultural norms that tend towards self-destructive behaviors.¬† Despite my initial skepticism, Bryan‚Äôs mission emerges as humanitarian. His ventures include Kernel, a brain activity monitoring company, and OS Fund, a science and tech venture capital firm. We explore Bryan‚Äôs exodus from Mormonism and his AI-centric vision for the future.¬† Amid critical press, I urge listeners to approach with discernment as Bryan delves into longevity science with emotional depth.

Dr. Oliver, best known as Bryan Johnson‚Äôs longevity doctor, joins Sober Head podcast to explain his three-level system for reversing biological aging. He describes Level 1 as foundational, evidence-based habits like exercise, optimal sleep, diet, VO‚ÇÇ max, and social health, which can extend lifespan by about 10-20%. Level 2 covers non-age-related factors and building a ‚Äúhealth Rolodex‚Äù of top experts, while Level 3 focuses on organ rejuvenation through advanced tools like gene therapy and AI-guided MRI analysis. He cautions against overhyped biological-age claims and quick fixes like HGH, supports moderate caloric restriction and GLP-1 use under medical guidance, and views rapamycin as promising but still unproven in humans. Now working with Only Health in Istanbul, Zolman is helping test experimental therapies such as follistatin and telomerase to measure true organ-by-organ rejuvenation.

And what parts of Johnson‚Äôs approach are actually helpful for the rest of us?If you're curious about biohacking, longevity science, or just trying to figure out how to live well as you grow older, this conversation offers critical insights, a few laughs, and a grounded vision for aging well‚Äîwithout losing yourself in the process.Please, support The Aging Well Podcast by hitting the ‚Äòlike‚Äô button, subscribing/following the podcast, sharing with a friend, and‚Ä¶.BUY the products you need to‚Ä¶ age well from our trusted affiliates and support the mission of ‚ÄòThe Aging Well Podcast‚Äô*.The Aging Well Podcast merchandise | Show how you are aging well | Use the promo code AGING WELL for free shipping on orders over $75 | https://theagingwellpodcast-shop.fourthwall.com/promo/AGINGWELLRebalance Health | products created by hormone health experts to lower cortisol, improve sleep, and minimize the impact of stress on the body and mind | https://rebalancehealth.com/AgingWellProlon | The Fasting Mimicking Diet (FMD) is a revolutionary five-day nutrition program scientifically formulated to mimic the effects of a prolonged water fast while still allowing nourishment - supporting the benefits of fasting without the challenges and risks that come from water-only fasts. | For the best available discount always use this link: https://prolonlife.com/theagingwellpodcastL-Nutra Health | The medical division of L-Nutra, focused on helping people manage and potentially reverse chronic health conditions, like type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, insulin resistance, and obesity, using personalized, lifestyle-based programs grounded in evidence, not prescriptions. | Use this link: https://l-nutrahealth.com/theagingwellpodcastThrive25‚ÄîYour personal longevity advisor | https://www.thrive25.com/early-access?via=william-jeffreyMemory Lane TV | the first therapeutic streaming platform for people living with dementia ‚Äî designed to replace overstimulating television with multisensory, evidence-based media that soothes, orients, and restores | for 30% off the annual subscription visit https://www.memory-lane.tv/?rfsn=8714090.a500b0Fusionary Formulas | Combining Ayurvedic wisdom with Western science for optimal health support. | 15% off Code: AGINGWELL | https://fusionaryformulas.com/Jigsaw Health | Trusted supplements. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fun to feel good.‚Äù | Click the following link for 10% off: https://www.jigsawhealth.com/?rfsn=8710089.1dddcf3&utm_source=refersion&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=8710089.1dddcf3Auro Wellness | Glutaryl‚ÄîAntioxidant spray that delivers high doses of glutathione (‚ÄúMaster Antioxidant‚Äù) | 10% off Code: AGINGWELL at https://aurowellness.com/?ref=1957Dr Lewis Nutrition | Fight neurodegeneration and cognitive decline with Daily Brain Care by Dr Lewis Nutrition‚Äîa proven daily formula designed to protect and restore brain function. | 10% off code: AGINGWELL or use the link: https://drlewisnutrition.com/AGINGWELLTruDiagnostic‚ÄîYour source for epigenetic testing | 12% off Code: AGEWELL or use the link: https://shop.trudiagnostic.com/discount/AGEWELL*We receive commission on these purchases.

Bryan Johnson,"""Bryan Johnson""",4GcEjPjIerCHUdSmhhg00O,"Bryan Johnson, The Man Who Wants to Live Forever, Tells His Life Story (Flashback)","In this full-length interview, Bryan Johnson, the founder of Venmo and CEO of Kernel, looks back on his upbringing in a Mormon community during his childhood in Provo, Utah. The 45-year-old debunks the misconceptions about polygamy in the Mormon community before discussing his missionary work in Ecuador and how the experience shifted his outlook on life to wanting to help people. After touching on his collegiate stint at Brigham Young University, Bryan discusses a few startup companies he established before looking back on the successful launch of a Chicago-based payment processing company called Braintree and selling it to PayPal. Moving along, Bryan explains why he stepped away from Braintree before detailing why he chose to invest $54 million into a neurotechnology company called Kernel and the groundbreaking ways the company's technology can measure/evaluate the human brain. He then claims that the company's technology can evaluate CTE while a person is still alive. As the introspective conversation moves along, Byran details his methods for reverse engineering the aging process.

Johnson sold his company, Braintree Venmo, to PayPal for $800m in 2013. Since then, he's been investing millions to slow and reverse his aging. In 2021, he set a World Record by reducing his epigenetic age by 5.1 years in 7 months. Johnson publicly blogs, sharing at no cost his protocols, data and learnings for others to implement and improve upon.¬† Project Blueprint, is an endeavor to achieve humanity and earth scale cooperation starting within Self. In 2023, Johnson launched Rejuvenation Olympics, an epigenetic leaderboard assessing one's speed of aging. Of the 1,750 people who have been using this state-of-the-art aging algorithm to track their progress longitudinally, Johnson ranks #1 in speed of age reduction. Johnson is also the founder & CEO of Kernel, creator of the world‚Äôs first mainstream non-invasive neuroimaging system; and OS Fund, where he invested $100M in the predictable engineering of atoms, molecules, and organisms into companies now collectively valued over $6B. He is an outdoor adventure enthusiast, pilot, and author of children‚Äôs books, Code 7 and The Proto Project.¬† Today we discuss Bryan's plan, daily habits, why he began to embark on this feat and much more .

While Bryan is well known in the longevity space, I‚Äôve been a fan of his work for years because of his neuroscience background.¬†Bryan started a company called Kernel, which makes devices that monitor and record brain activity. Kernel uses what I would call the most comprehensive way of looking at the human brain ever. He is the founder of OS Fund and Braintree, and he spearheads Project Blueprint, an anti-aging experiment where he‚Äôs spent multiple years and millions of dollars developing an algorithm to live longer.¬†In today‚Äôs wide-ranging talk, we discuss the future of optimizing our brains with AI‚Äîdelving into all things biohacking and longevity while exploring complicated questions like‚Ä¶ Can you die of loneliness? And‚Ä¶ Are your critics making you old?Plus, we talk testosterone‚Äîan often triggering topic, but an essential conversation.

He has for the past two years been eating the same meals, taking 105 supplements each day, and doing the same physical training to create a non-disputable baseline. Bryan's hope is to see if he could get into optimal health but also turn back his chronological age. I asked Bryan how long this experiment will go on and his answer is ""forever"".A lot of people have an intense response to his experiment, but rather than dismissing it or throwing some superlatives at what he's doing, I thought it would be better to go in and try to understand and learn from him, his perspective. Bryan and his team at Kernel are collecting data, measuring over 200 health points, taking pictures of his organs, observing the brain under different circumstances and who knows maybe it's all information that can help us.

Bryan Johnson on Immortality, AI & the End of Meaning","What if the real threat to humanity isn‚Äôt death, but the belief that life needs to mean something?In this episode of Endgame, Amanda Cassatt and Bryan Johnson explore the architecture of a world where death is optional and meaning might be too. Rejecting first-principles thinking, the problem-solving method rooted in historical patterns and known truths, Bryan proposes zeroth-principles thinking: a framework that imagines human existence beyond inherited assumptions. In this future, meaning may vanish along with our drive for ambition, legacy, and identity.They discuss why accomplishment might be nothing more than preparation for death, how attachment to power, wealth, and status could undermine our survival, and why it‚Äôs easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism. Bryan also explores a world beyond game theory, where humanity disables evolutionary instincts like competition and status-seeking, treating them as flaws in our biological code.This is a philosophical autopsy of mortality, meaning, and the psychological machinery we‚Äôve built around being human.TIMESTAMPS:¬†02:56 Debating Life and Death: The Immortality Argument06:06 The Case Against Immortality: Societal Implications08:50 Wealth, Power, and the Future: A Generational Perspective11:51 The Role of Legislation in a Changing Society14:34 The Nature of Meaning: Life, Death, and Legacy17:35 The Evolution of Human Behavior: Risk and Sacrifice20:46 Post-Meaning: Redefining Existence in a New Era23:46 The Future of Innovation: Aging and Stagnation26:27 The Role of AI: Navigating Uncertainty and Change29:26 The Dilemma of Existence: Freedom vs. Attachment32:35 The Final Thoughts: Embracing Uncertainty and ChangeRESOURCES:Subscribe to Endgame: https://www.youtube.com/@endgamepodcast Amanda on X: https://x.com/amandacassatt  Serotonin on X: https://x.com/serotonin  Endgame on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6iSvbKOJWoEPiAoGmiulkd   Endgame on Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/endgame-with-amanda-cassatt/id1801809440  Substack: https://substack.com/@UCInZsV3L1nDGoFjxoNUnPQQ",https://open.spotify.com/episode/0YGPau3HILciyawc4wSOox,2025-07-15,6iSvbKOJWoEPiAoGmiulkd,Endgame with Amanda Cassatt,Serotonin,1761323014.7022502

Bryan Johnson,"""Bryan Johnson""",4mHIB7xmYCYK2cOMxcpNCx,Behind the Curtain of Immortality: The Dark Side of Bryan Johnson's Biohacking Empire,"Sure! Here‚Äôs a podcast-style summary and breakdown of the YouTube video titled ""How Bryan Johnson Exploited Employees With NDAs"" by The New York Times. üéôÔ∏è Brief Summary:Bryan Johnson, the tech millionaire known for his anti-aging Biohacking project ‚ÄúBlueprint,‚Äù didn‚Äôt just draw headlines with his extreme health routines‚Äîhe also attracted controversy behind the scenes. According to a New York Times investigation, Johnson had employees sign unusually restrictive non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) that critics argue went beyond protecting trade secrets and veered into silencing workers. The video explores how these legal tools became methods of control, limiting employees‚Äô ability to speak freely about their experiences‚Äîeven after they left the company. It‚Äôs not just about longevity‚Äîit‚Äôs about power, contracts, and the human toll behind one man‚Äôs quest to live forever. üß† Key Points:  The Investigation:The New York Times dug into internal documents and spoke with former employees to reveal how Johnson used sweeping NDAs to keep employees from discussing anything related to his company, even after their tenure ended.  What the NDAs Said:Some NDAs in Johnson‚Äôs company contained language that prohibited employees from discussing their work‚Äîor even acknowledging their connection to the company‚Äîfor up to five years after departure.  Employee Allegations:Multiple former employees said they felt intimidated by the NDAs and feared legal retribution if they spoke out. One former team member said, ‚ÄúIt was like being in a house of mirrors. Everyone was afraid to talk.‚Äù  Emotional Culture:Employees described a high-pressure culture where Johnson‚Äôs personal health became the focal point of company activities. Some called it ‚Äúcult-like,‚Äù with daily routines centered around his extreme diet, exercise, and even feces analysis.  Public vs. Private:While Johnson shares a lot about his health and routines publicly, critics argue he‚Äôs far more secretive about how his companies operate and how employees are treated behind the scenes.  Legal Experts Chime In:Lawyers interviewed in the video say Johnson‚Äôs NDAs raise serious legal and ethical concerns. One employment law professor noted, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really the weaponization of legal documents against employees.‚Äù  Larger Trend:NDAs have increasingly been called into question in Silicon Valley, especially when they‚Äôre used to silence workers rather than protect proprietary technology.  No Clear Response:Johnson declined to be interviewed for the video, and did not respond to follow-up questions from the Times, according to the reporting team.   üì¶ Context & Accuracy Check:This video appears to be based on original New York Times reporting, and their investigative journalism is typically well-sourced. The NDAs described align with broader trends in the tech industry where secrecy is often enforced through aggressive legal measures. While Johnson has not publicly responded to these specific allegations, his online persona of full transparency contrasts sharply with the secrecy enforced behind the scenes, lending credibility to the concerns raised. üéß Final Takeaway:The pursuit of eternal youth may be fascinating, but as this report reveals, it can also come at a very human cost. For Bryan Johnson, optimizing his body might involve compromising the voices of the people who made it all possible. Let me know if you'd like a deeper dive into Blueprint, Bryan Johnson‚Äôs anti-aging regimen, or the rise of NDA abuse in tech.Link to Article",https://open.spotify.com/episode/4mHIB7xmYCYK2cOMxcpNCx,2025-03-31,7kaRmk3R5jizHxRhRy1zAc,jawbreaker.io,jawbreaker.io,1761323015.6523042

His favorite part of the day as a kid were the early mornings he spent wandering the fields with his dog, shooting at targets with his BB gun, which gave him a feeling of ‚Äúendless possibility.‚ÄùNow he‚Äôs playing in a video game of his own making, as he puts it, that allows him to explore the ‚Äúinfinite expanse‚Äù of the brain and how it might be measured and shaped to help humanity thrive.But before he could found Kernel, a neurotech company building scalable brain-recording devices, Johnson had to sell Braintree ‚Äì a pioneering mobile payment platform that he took through the New Venture Challenge.In this podcast episode, Johnson, MBA ‚Äô07, speaks with Starr Marcello, deputy dean of MBA programs at Chicago Booth and formerly executive director of the Polsky Center.In a fascinating, at times mind-bending interview, Johnson discusses how the NVC taught him to communicate his vision for Braintree; why big ecommerce companies trusted his tiny startup with their payment platforms; and how he leads sophisticated engineering companies without being an engineer himself.Johnson, who sold Braintree to PayPal for $800 million and used the money to start Kernel, also reveals that he rarely spends time in the present anymore as he contemplates what intelligence will look like in the future.‚ÄúFor some reason, I don‚Äôt know why, I feel responsible for the year 2500,‚Äù he said.Listen now on Apple, Spotify, Overcast, or wherever you get your podcasts.",https://open.spotify.com/episode/3igui3A8Hyp4GJcSSzcLYo,2021-05-27,5iVq744KhLgF4klPxZbLSM,Where Are They Now?,Polsky Center,1761323017.365754

The USS Virginia's entanglement with fishing nets near Troms√∏ brings attention to the increasing military presence in Arctic waters and its impact on local fishing communities, as NATO maintains vigilance against Russian naval activities in the region.We then examine tech millionaire Bryan Johnson's latest setback in his ambitious anti-aging quest. The founder of Braintree and Kernel, who spends $2 million annually on longevity interventions, recently experienced a severe allergic reaction during his ""Project Baby Face"" treatment. While Johnson claims remarkable results in reducing his biological age, medical experts express serious concerns about his experimental methods and their safety.Our deep dive focuses on groundbreaking observations from the James Webb Space Telescope that are challenging our understanding of gravity. The telescope's discovery of unexpectedly large and bright galaxies in the early universe aligns more closely with Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) than with traditional dark matter theory, potentially forcing scientists to reconsider fundamental aspects of how galaxies form and evolve.From Perplexity's Discover Feed: https://www.perplexity.ai/page/norwegian-fishermen-catch-u-s-eqnj8WAcQFih4itiu7zUvAhttps://www.perplexity.ai/page/bryan-johnsons-blueprint-exper-czZlO9DlRJOSqLbMqv2G4Ahttps://www.perplexity.ai/page/alternate-theory-of-gravity-iDOdAKY1TO2S.sFOPm64fwPerplexity is the fastest and most powerful way to search the web.

The high cost of prescription drugs contributes, and little has been done to change that except for the government passing the Affordable Insulin Now Act at the end of 2022, enacted in 2023. But in January 2022 Mark Cuban launched Cost Plus Drugs that has transformed how many Americans can get their prescriptions filled at a fraction of the prevailing prices, bypassing pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) that control 80% of US prescriptions. That was just the beginning of a path of creative destruction (disruptive innovation, after Schumpeter) of many key components American healthcare that Cuban is leading, with Cost Plus Marketplace, Cost Plus Wellness and much more to come.

So Mark, welcome.Mark Cuban (00:25):Thanks for having me, Eric.Eric Topol (00:27):Yeah, I mean, what you're doing, you‚Äôve become a hero to millions of Americans getting them their medications at a fraction of the cost they're used to. And you are really challenging the PBM industry, which I've delved into more than ever, just in prep for our conversation. It's just amazing what this group of companies, namely the three big three CVS Caremark, Optum of UnitedHealth and Express Scripts of Cigna with a market of almost $600 billion this year, what they're doing, how can they get away with all this stuff?Inner Workings of Pharmacy Benefit ManagersMark Cuban (01:03):I mean, they're just doing business. I really don't blame them. I blame the people who contract with them. All the companies, particularly the bigger companies, the self-insured companies, where the CEO really doesn't have an understanding of their healthcare or pharmacy benefits. And so, the big PBMs paid them rebates, which they think is great if you're a CEO, when in reality it's really just a loan against the money spent by your sickest employees, and they just don't understand that. So a big part of my time these days is going to CEOs and sitting with them and explaining to them that you're getting ripped off on both your pharmacy and your healthcare side.Eric Topol (01:47):Yeah, it's amazing to me the many ways that they get away with this. I mean, they make companies sign NDAs. They're addicted to rebates. They have all sorts of ways a channel of funds to themselves. I mean, all the things you could think of whereby they even have these GPOs. Each of these companies has a group purchasing organization (I summarized in the Table below).Mark Cuban (02:12):Yeah, which gives them, it's crazy because with those GPOs. The GPO does the deal with the pharmacy manufacturer. Then the GPO also does the deal with the PBM, and then the PBM goes to the self-insured employer in particular and says, hey, we're going to pass through all the rebates. But what they don't say is they've already skimmed off 5%, 10%, 20% or more off the top through their GPO. But that's not even the worst of it. That's just money, right? I mean, that's important, but I mean, even the biggest companies rarely own their own claims data.Mark Cuban (02:45):Now think about what that means. It means you can't get smarter about the wellness of your employees and their families. You want to figure out the best way to do GLP-1s and figure out how to reduce diabetes, whatever it may be. You don't have that claims data. And then they don't allow the companies to control their own formularies. So we've seen Humira biosimilars come out and the big PBMs have done their own version of the biosimilar where we have a product called Yusimry, which is only $594 a month, which is cheaper than the cheapest biosimilar that the big three are selling. And so, you would think in a normal relationship, they would want to bring on this new product to help the employer. No, they won't do it. If the employer asks, can I just add Cost Plus Drugs to my network? They'll say no, every single time.Mark Cuban (03:45):Their job is not to save the employer money, particularly after they've given a rebate. Because once they give that loan, that rebate to the employer, they need to get that money back. It's not a gift. It's a loan and they need to have the rebates, and we don't do rebates with them at all. And I can go down the list. They don't control the formula. They don't control, you mentioned the NDAs. They can't talk to manufacturers, so they can't go to Novo or to Lilly and say, let's put together a GLP-1 wellness program. All these different things that just are common sense. It's not happening. And so, the good news is when I walk into these companies that self-insured and talk to the CEO or CFO, I'm not asking them to do something that's not in their best interest or not in the best interest of the lives they cover. I'm saying, we can save you money and you can improve the wellness of your employees and their families. Where's the downside?Eric Topol (04:40):Oh, yeah. Yeah. And the reason they can't see the claims is because of the privacy issues?Mark Cuban (04:46):No, no. That's just a business decision in the contract that the PBMs have made. You can go and ask. I mean, you have every right to your own claims. You don't need to have it personally identified. You want to find out how many people have GLP-1s or what are the trends, or God forbid there's another Purdue Pharma thing going on, and someone prescribing lots of opioids. You want to be able to see those things, but they won't do it. And that's only on the sponsor side. It's almost as bad if not worse on the manufacturer side.Eric Topol (05:20):Oh, yeah. Well, some of the work of PBMs that you've been talking about were well chronicled in the New York Times, a couple of major articles by Reed Abelson and Rebecca Robbins: The Opaque Industry Secretly Inflating Prices for Prescription Drugs and The Powerful Companies Driving Local Drugstores Out of Business. We'll link those because I think some people are not aware of all the things that are going on in the background.Mark Cuban (05:39):You see in their study and what they reported on the big PBMs, it's crazy the way it works. And literally if there was transparency, like Cost Plus offers, the cost of medications across the country could come down 20%, 30% or more.Cost Plus DrugsEric Topol (05:55):Oh, I mean, it is amazing, really. And now let's get into Cost Plus. I know that a radiologist, Alex Oshmyansky contacted you with a cold email a little over three years ago, and you formed Cost Plus Drugs on the basis of that, right?Mark Cuban (06:12):Yep, that's exactly what happened.Eric Topol (06:15):I give you credit for responding to cold emails and coming up with a brilliant idea with this and getting behind it and putting your name behind it. And what you've done, so you started out with something like 110 generics and now you're up well over 1,200 or 2,500 or something like that?Mark Cuban (06:30):And adding brands. And so, started with 111. Now we're around 2,500 and trying to grow it every single day. And not only that, just to give people an overview. When you go to www.costplusdrugs.com and you put in the name of your medication, let's just say it's tadalafil, and if it comes up. In this case, it will. It'll show you our actual cost, and then we just mark it up 15%. It's the same markup for everybody, and if you want it, we'll have a pharmacist check it. And so, that's a $5 fee. And then if you want ship to mail order, it's $5 for shipping. And if you want to use our pharmacy network, then we can connect you there and you can just pick it up at a local pharmacy.Eric Topol (07:10):Yeah, no, it's transparency. We don't have a lot of that in healthcare in America, right?Mark Cuban (07:15):No. And literally, Eric, the smartest thing that we did, and we didn't expect this, it's always the law of unintended consequences. The smartest thing we did was publish our entire price list because that allowed any company, any sponsor, CMS, researchers to compare our prices to what others were already paying. And we've seen studies come out saying, for this X number of urology drugs, CMS would save $3.6 billion a year. For this number of heart drugs at this amount per year, for chemotherapy drugs or MS drugs this amount. And so, it's really brought attention to the fact that for what PBMs call specialty drugs, whether there's nothing special about them, we can save people a lot of money.Eric Topol (08:01):It's phenomenal. As a cardiologist, I looked up a couple of the drugs that I'm most frequently prescribed, just like Rosuvastatin what went down from $134 to $5.67 cents or Valsartan it went down from $69 to $7.40 cents. But of course, there's some that are much more dramatic, like as you mentioned, whether it's drugs for multiple sclerosis, the prostate cancer. I mean, some of these are just thousands and thousands of dollars per month that are saved, brought down to levels that you wouldn't think would even be conceivable. And this has been zero marketing, right?Mark Cuban (08:42):Yeah, none. It's all been word of mouth and my big mouth, of course. Going out there and doing interviews like this and going to major media, but it's amazing. We get emails and letters and people coming up to us almost single day saying, you saved my grandma's life. You saved my life. We weren't going to be able to afford our imatinib or our MS medication. And it went from being quoted $2,000 a month to $33 a month. It's just insane things like that that are still happening.Eric Topol (09:11):Well, this is certainly one of the biggest shakeups to occur in US healthcare in years. And what you've done in three years is just extraordinary. This healthcare in this country is with its over 4 trillion, pushing $5 trillion a year of expenditure.[New CMS report this week pegs the number at $4.867 trillion for 2023]Mark Cuban (09:30):It's interesting. I think it's really fixable. This has been the easiest industry to the disrupt I've ever been involved in. And it's not even close because all it took was transparency and not jacking up margins to market. We choose to use a fixed margin markup. Some choose to price to market, the Martin Shkreli approach, if you will. And just by being transparent, we've had an impact. And the other side of it is, it's the same concept on the healthcare side. Transparency helps, but to go a little field of pharmacy if you want. The insane part, and this applies to care and pharmacy, whatever plan we have, whether it's for health or whether it's for pharmaceuticals, there's typically a deductible, typically a copay, and typically a co-insurance.Insurance CompaniesMark Cuban (10:20):The crazy part of all that is that people taking the default risk, the credit risk are the providers. It's you, it's the hospital, it's the clinics that you work for. Which makes no sense whatsoever that the decisions that you or I make for our personal insurance or for the companies we run, or if we work for the government, what we do with Medicare or Medicare Advantage, the decisions we all make impacts the viability of providers starting with the biggest hospital systems. And so, as a result, they become subprime lenders without a car or a house to go after if they can't collect. And so, now you see a bunch of people, particularly those under the ACA with the $9,000, the bronze plans or $18,000 out-of-pocket limits go into debt, significant medical debt. And it's unfortunate. We look at the people who are facing these problems and think, well, it must be the insurance companies.Mark Cuban (11:23):It's actually not even the insurance companies. It's the overall design of the system. But underneath that, it's still whoever picks the insurance companies and sets plans that allow those deductibles, that's the core of the problem. And until we get to a system where the providers aren't responsible for the credit for defaults and dealing with all that credit risk, it's almost going to be impossible to change. Because when you see stories like we've all seen in news of a big healthcare, a BUCA healthcare (Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS), UnitedHealth, Cigna, and Aetna/CVS) plan with all the pre-authorizations and denials, typically they're not even taking the insurance risk. They're acting as the TPA (third party administrator) as the claims processor effectively for whoever hired them. And it goes back again, just like I talked about before. And as long as CMS hires or allows or accepts these BUCAs with these plans for Medicare for the ACA (Affordable care Act), whatever it may be, it's not going to work. As long as self-insured employers and the 50 million lives they cover hire these BUCAs to act as the TPAs, not as insurance companies and give them leeway on what to approve and what to authorize and what not to authorize. The system's going to be a mess, and that's where we are today.Academic Health System PartnershipsEric Topol (12:41):Yeah. Well, you've been talking of course to employers and enlightening them, and you're also enlightening the public, of course. That's why you have millions of people that are saving their cost of medications, but recently you struck a partnership with Penn Medicine. That's amazing. So is that your first academic health system that you approached?Cost Plus MarketplaceMark Cuban (13:00):I don't know if it was the first we approached, but it was certainly one of the biggest that we signed. We've got Cost Plus Marketplace (CPM) where we make everything from injectables to you name it, anything a hospital might buy. But again, at a finite markup, we make eight and a half percent I think when it's all said and done. And that saves hospital systems millions of dollars a year.Eric Topol (13:24):Yeah. So that's a big change in the way you're proceeding because what it was just pills that you were buying from the pharma companies, now you're actually going to make injectables and you're going to have a manufacturing capability. Is that already up and going?Mark Cuban (13:39):That's all up and going as of March. We're taking sterile injectables that are on the shortage list, generic and manufacturing them in Dallas using a whole robotics manufacturing plant that really Alex created. He's the rocket scientist behind it. And we‚Äôre limited in capacity now, we're limited about 2 million vials, but we'll sell those to Cost Plus Marketplace, and we'll also sell those direct. So Cost Plus Marketplace isn't just the things we manufacture. It's a wide variety of products that hospitals buy that we then have a minimal markup, and then for the stuff we manufacture, we'll sell those to direct to like CHS was our first customer.Eric Topol (14:20):Yeah, that's a big expansion from going from the pills to this. Wow.Mark Cuban (14:24):It's a big, big expansion, but it goes to the heart of being transparent and not being greedy, selling on a markup. And ourselves as a company, being able to remain lean and mean. The only way we can sell at such a low markup. We have 20 employees on the Cost Plus side and 40 employees involved with the factories, and that's it.Eric Topol (14:46):Wow. So with respect to, you had this phenomenal article and interview with WIRED Magazine just this past week. I know Lauren Goode interviewed you, and she said, Mark, is this really altruistic and I love your response. You said, ‚Äúhow much f*****g money do I need? I'm not trying to land on Mars.‚Äù And then you said, ‚Äúat this point in my life, it‚Äôs just like more money, or f**k up the healthcare industry.‚Äù This was the greatest, Mark. I mean, I got to tell you, it was really something.Mark Cuban (15:18):Yeah.Eric Topol (15:19):Well, in speaking of that, of course, the allusion to a person we know well, Elon. He posted on X/Twitter in recent days , I think just three or four days ago, shouldn't the American people be getting their money's worth? About this high healthcare administration costs where the US is completely away from any other OECD country. And as you and I know, we have the worst outcomes and the most costs of all the rich countries in the world. There's just nothing new here. Maybe it's new to him, but you had a fabulous response on both X and Bluesky where you went over all these things point by point. And of course, the whole efforts that you've been working on now for three years. You also mentioned something that was really interesting that I didn't know about were these ERISA lawsuits[Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974.] Can you tell us about that?ERISA LawsuitsMark Cuban (16:13):Yeah, that's a great question, Eric. So for self-insured companies in particular, we have a fiduciary responsibility on a wellness and on a financial basis to offer the members, your employees and their families the best outcomes at the best price. Now, you can't guarantee best outcomes, but you have to be able to explain the choices you made. You don't have to pick the cheapest, but again, you have to be able to explain why you made the choices that you did. And because a lot of companies have been doing, just like we discussed earlier, doing deals on the pharmacy side with just these big PBMs, without accounting for best practices, best price, best outcomes, a couple companies got sued. Johnson and Johnson and Wells Fargo were the first to get sued. And I think that's just the beginning. That's just the writing on the wall. I think they'll lose because they just dealt with the big pharmacy PBMs. And I think that's one of the reasons why we're so busy at Cost Plus and why I'm so busy because we're having conversation after conversation with companies and plenty of enough lawyers for that matter who want to see a price list and be able to compare what they're paying to what we sell for to see if they're truly living up to that responsibility.Eric Topol (17:28):Yeah, no, that's a really important thing that's going on right now that I think a lot of people don't know about. Now, the government of the US think because it's the only government of any rich country in the world, if not any country that doesn't negotiate prices, i.e., CMS or whatever. And only with the recent work of insulin, which is a single one drug, was there reduction of price. And of course, it's years before we'll see other drugs. How could this country not negotiate drugs all these years where every other place in the world they do negotiate with pharma?Mark Cuban (18:05):Because as we alluded to earlier, the first line in every single pharmaceutical and healthcare contract says, you can't talk about this contract. It‚Äôs like fight club. The number one rule of fight club is you can't talk about fight club, and it's really difficult to negotiate prices when it's opaque and everything's obfuscated where you can't really get into the details. So it's not that we're not capable of it, but it's just when there's no data there, it's really difficult because look, up until we started publishing our prices, how would anybody know?Mark Cuban (18:39):I mean, how was anybody going to compare numbers? And so, when the government or whoever started to negotiate, they tried to protect themselves and they tried to get data, but those big PBMs certainly have not been forthcoming. We‚Äôve come along and publish our price list and all that starts to change. Now in terms of the bigger picture, there is a solution there, as I said earlier, but it really comes down to talking to the people who make the decisions to hire the big insurance companies and the big PBMs and telling them, no, you're not acting in your own best interest. Here's anybody watching out there. Ask your PBM if they can audit. If you can audit rather your PBM contract. What they'll tell you is, yeah, you can, but you have to use our people. It's insane. And that's from top to bottom. And so, I'm a big believer that if we can get starting with self-insured employers to act in their own best interest, and instead of working with a big PBM work with a pass-through PBM. A pass-through PBM will allow you to keep your own claims, own all your own data, allow you to control your own formulary.Mark Cuban (19:54):You make changes where necessary, no NDA, so you can't talk to manufacturers. All these different abilities that just seem to make perfect sense are available to all self-insured employers. And if the government, same thing. If the government requires pass-through PBMs, the price of medications will drop like a rock.Eric Topol (20:16):Is that possible? You think that could happen?Mark Cuban (20:19):Yes. Somebody's got to understand it and do it. I'm out there screaming, but we will see what happens with the new administration. There's nothing hard about it. And it's the same thing with Medicare and Medicare Advantage healthcare plans. There's nothing that says you have to use the biggest companies. Now, the insurance companies have to apply and get approved, but again, there's a path there to work with companies that can reduce costs and improve outcomes. The biggest challenge in my mind, and I'm still trying to work through this to fully understand it. I think where we really get turned upside down as a country is we try to avoid fraud from the provider perspective and the patient perspective. We're terrified that patients are going to use too much healthcare, and like everybody's got Munchausen disease.Mark Cuban (21:11):And we're terrified that the providers are going to charge too much or turn into Purdue Pharma and over-prescribe or one of these surgery mills that just is having somebody get surgery just so they can make money. So in an effort to avoid those things, we ask the insurance companies and the PBMs to do pre-authorizations, and that's the catch 22. How do we find a better way to deal with fraud at the patient and provider level? Because once we can do that, and maybe it's AI, maybe it's accepting fraud, maybe it's imposing criminal penalties if somebody does those things. But once we can overcome that, then it becomes very transactional. Because the reality is most insurance companies aren't insurance companies. 50 million lives are covered by self-insured employers that use the BUCAs, the big insurance companies, but not as insurance companies.Eric Topol (22:07):Yeah, I was going to ask you about that because if you look at these three big PBMs that control about 80% of the market, not the pass-throughs that you just mentioned, but the big ones, they each are owned by an insurance company. And so, when the employer says, okay, we're going to cover your healthcare stuff here, we're going to cover your prescriptions there.Mark Cuban (22:28):Yeah, it's all vertically integrated.Mark Cuban (22:36):And it gets even worse than that, Eric. So they also own specialty pharmacies, ‚Äúspecialty pharmacies‚Äù that will require you to buy from. And as I alluded to earlier, a lot of these medications like Imatinib, they'll list as being a specialty medication, but it's a pill. There's nothing special about it, but it allows them to charge a premium. And that's a big part of how the PBMs make a lot of their money, the GPO stuff we talked about, but also forcing an employer to go through the specialty mail order company that charges an arm and the leg.Impact on Hospitals and ProceduresEric Topol (23:09):Yeah. Well, and the point you made about transparency, we've seen this of course across US healthcare. So for example, as you know, if you were to look at what does it cost to have an operation like let's say a knee replacement at various hospitals, you can find that it could range fivefold. Of course, you actually get the cost, and it could be the hospital cost, and then there's the professional cost. And the same thing occurs for if you're having a scan, if you're having an MRI here or there. So these are also this lack of transparency and it's hard to get to the numbers, of course. There seems to be so many other parallels to the PBM story. Would you go to these other areas you think in the future?Mark Cuban (23:53):Yeah, we're doing it now. I'm doing it. So we have this thing called project dog food, and what it is, it's for my companies and what we've done is say, look, let's understand how the money works in healthcare.Mark Cuban (24:05):And when you think about it, when you go to get that knee done, what happens? Well, they go to your insurance company to get a pre-authorization. Your doctor says you need a knee replacement. I got both my hips replaced. Let's use that. Doctor says, Mark, you need your hips replaced. Great, right? Let's set up an appointment. Well, first the insurance company has to authorize it, okay, they do or they don't, but the doctor eats their time up trying to deal with the pre-authorization. And if it's denied, the doctor's time is eaten up and an assistance's time is eaten up. Some other administrator's time is eaten up, the employer's time is eaten up. So that's one significant cost. And then from there, there's a deductible. Now I can afford my deductible, but if there is an individual getting that hip replacement who can't afford the deductible, now all of a sudden you're still going to be required to do that hip replacement, most likely.Mark Cuban (25:00):Because in most of these contracts that self-insured employers sign, Medicare Advantage has, Medicare has, it says that between the insurance company and the provider, in this case, the hospital, you have to do the operation even if the deductibles not paid. So now the point of all this is you have the hospital in this case potentially accumulating who knows how much bad debt. And it's not just the lost amount of millions and millions and billions across the entire healthcare spectrum that's there. It's all the incremental administrative costs. The lawyers, the benefits for those people, the real estate, the desk, the office space, all that stuff adds up to $10 billion plus just because the hospitals take on that credit default risk. But wait, there's more. So now the surgery happens, you send the bill to the insurance company. The insurance company says, well, we're not going to pay you. Well, we have a contract. This is what it says, hip replacement's $34,000. Well, we don't care first, we're going to wait. So we get the time value of money, and then we're going to short pay you.Mark Cuban (26:11):So the hospital gets short paid. So what do they have to do? They have to sue them or send letters or whatever it is to try to get their money. When we talk to the big hospital systems, they say that's 2%. That's 2% of their revenue. So you have all these associated credit loss dollars, you've got the 2% of, in a lot of cases, billions and billions of dollars. And so, when you add all those things up, what happens? Well, what happens is because the providers are losing all that money and having to spend all those incremental dollars for the administration of all that, they have to jack up prices.Eric Topol (26:51):Yeah. Right.Mark Cuban (26:53):So what we have done, we've said, look for my companies, we're going to pay you cash. We're going to pay you cash day one. When Mark gets that hip replacement, that checks in the bank before the operation starts, if that's the way you want it. Great, they're not going to have pre-authorizations. We're going to trust you until you give us a reason not to trust you. We're not short paying, obviously, because we're paying cash right there then.Mark Cuban (27:19):But in a response for all that, because we're cutting out all those ancillary costs and credit risk, I want Medicare pricing. Now the initial response is, well, Medicare prices, that's awful. We can't do it. Well, when you really think about the cost and operating costs of a hospital, it's not the doctors, it's not the facilities, it's all the administration that cost all the money. It's all the credit risks that cost all the money. And so, if you remove that credit risk and all the administration, all those people, all that real estate, all those benefits and overhead associated with them, now all of a sudden selling at a Medicare price for that hip replacement is really profitable.Eric Topol (28:03):Now, is that a new entity Cost Plus healthcare?Mark Cuban (28:07):Well, it's called Cost Plus Wellness. It's not an entity. What we're going to do, so the part I didn't mention is all the direct contracts that we do that have all these pieces, as part of them that I just mentioned, we're going to publish them.Eric Topol (28:22):Ah, okay.Mark Cuban (28:23):And you can see exactly what we've done. And if you think about the real role of the big insurances companies for hospitals, it's a sales funnel.Getting Rid of Insurance CompaniesEric Topol (28:33):Yeah, yeah. Well, in fact, I really was intrigued because you did a podcast interview with Andrew Beam and the New England Journal of Medicine AI, and in that they talked about getting rid of the insurers, the insurance industry, just getting rid of it and just make it a means test for people. So it's not universal healthcare, it's a different model that you described. Can you go over that? I thought it was fantastic.Mark Cuban (29:00):Two pieces there. Let's talk about universal healthcare first. So for my companies, for our project dog food for the Mark Cuban companies, if for any employee or any of the lives we cover, if they work within network, anybody we have the direct contract with its single-payer. They pay their premiums, but they pay nothing else out of pocket. That's the definition of single-payer.Eric Topol (29:24):Yeah.Mark Cuban (29:25):So if we can get all this done, then the initial single-payers will be self-insured employers because it'll be more cost effective to them to do this approach. We hope, we still have to play it all through. So that's part one. In terms of everybody else, then you can say, why do we need insurance companies if they're not even truly acting as insurance companies? You're not taking full risk because even if it's Medicare Advantage, they're getting a capitated amount per month. And then that's getting risk adjusted because of the population you have, and then there's also an index depending on the location, so there's more or less money that occurs then. So let's just do what we need to do in this particular case, because the government is effectively eliminating the risk for the insurance company for the most part. And if you look at the margins for Medicare Advantage, I was just reading yesterday, it's like $1,700 a year for the average Medicare Advantage plan. So it's not like they're taking a lot of risk. All they're doing is trying to deny as many claims as they can.Eric Topol (30:35):Deny, Deny. Yeah.Mark Cuban (30:37):So instead, let's just get somebody who's a TPA, somebody who does the transaction, the claims processing, and whoever's in charge. It could be CMS, can set the terms for what's accepted and what's denied, and you can have a procedure for people that get denied that want to challenge it. And that's great, there's one in place now, but you make it a little simpler. But you take out the economics for the insurance company to just deny, deny, deny. There's no capitation. There's no nothing.Mark Cuban (31:10):The government just says, okay, we're hiring this TPA to handle the claims processing. It is your job. We're paying you per transaction.Mark Cuban (31:18):You don't get paid more if you deny. You don't get paid less if you deny. There's no bonuses if you keep it under a certain amount, there's no penalties If you go above a certain amount. We want you just to make sure that the patient involved is getting the best care, end of story. And if there's fraud involved as the government, because we have access to all that claims data, we're going to introduce AI that reviews that continuously.Mark Cuban (31:44):So that we can see things that are outliers or things that we question, and there's going to mean mistakes, but the bet was, if you will, where we save more and get better outcomes that way versus the current system and I think we will. Now, what ends up happening on top of that, once you have all that claims data and all that information and everybody's interest is aligned, best care at the best price, no denials unless it's necessary, reduce and eliminate fraud. Once everybody's in alignment, then as long as that's transparent. If the city of Dallas decides for all the lives they cover the 300,000 lives they cover between pharmacy and healthcare, we can usually in actuarial tables and some statistical analysis, we can say, you know what, even with a 15% tolerance, it's cheaper for us just to pay upfront and do this single-pay program, all our employees in the lives we cover, because we know what it's going to take.Mark Cuban (32:45):If the government decides, well, instead of Medicare Advantage the way it was, we know all the costs. Now we can say for all Medicare patients, we'll do Medicare for all, simply because we have definitive and deterministic pricing. Great. Now, there's still going to be outlier issues like all the therapies that cost a million dollars or whatever. But my attitude there is if CMS goes to Lilly, Novo, whoever for their cure for blindness that's $3.4 million. Well, that's great, but what we'll say is, okay, give us access to your books. We want to know what your breakeven point is. What is that breakeven point annually? We'll write you a check for that.Eric Topol (33:26):Yeah.Mark Cuban (33:27):If we have fewer patients than need that, okay, you win. If we have more patients than need that, it's like a Netflix subscription with unlimited subscribers, then we will have whatever it is, because then the manufacturer doesn't lose money, so they can't complain about R&D and not being able to make money. And that's for the CMS covered population. You can do a Netflix type subscription for self-insured employers. Hey, it's 25 cents per month per employee or per life covered for the life of the patent, and we'll commit to that. And so, now all of a sudden you get to a point where healthcare starts becoming not only transparent but deterministic.Eric Topol (34:08):Yeah. What you outline here in these themes are extraordinary. And one of the other issues that you are really advocating is patient empowerment, but one of the problems we have in the US is that people don't own their data. They don't even have all their data. I expect you'd be a champion of that as well.Mark Cuban (34:27):Well, of course. Yeah. I mean, look, I've got into arguments with doctors and public health officials about things like getting your own blood tested. I've been an advocate of getting my own blood tested for 15 years, and it helped me find out that I needed thyroid medication and all of these things. So I'm a big advocate. There's some people that think that too much data gives you a lot of false positives, and people get excited in this day and age to get more care when it should only be done if there are symptoms. I'm not a believer in that at all. I think now, particularly as AI becomes more applicable and available, you'll be able to be smarter about the data you capture. And that was always my final argument. Either you trust doctors, or you don't. Because even if there's an aberrational TSH reading and minus 4.4 and it's a little bit high, well the doctor's going to say, well, let's do another blood test in a month or two. The doctor is still the one that has to write the prescription. There's no downside to trusting your doctor in my mind.Eric Topol (35:32):And what you're bringing up is that we're already seeing how AI can pick up things even in the normal range, the trends long before a clinician physician would pick it up. Now, last thing I want to say is you are re-imagining healthcare like no one. I mean, there's what you're doing here. It started with some pills and it's going in a lot of different directions. You are rocking it here. I didn't even know some of the latest things that you're up to. This seems to be the biggest thing you've ever done.Mark Cuban (36:00):I hope so.Mark Cuban (36:01):I mean, like we said earlier, what could be better than people saying our healthcare system is good. What changed? That Cuban guy.Eric Topol (36:10):Well, did you give up Shark Tank so you could put more energy into this?Mark Cuban (36:16):Not really. It was more for my kids.Eric Topol (36:19):Okay, okay.Mark Cuban (36:20):They go hand in hand, obviously. I can do this stuff at home as opposed to sitting on a set wondering if I should invest in Dude Wipes again.Eric Topol (36:28):Well, look, we're cheering for you. This is, I've not seen a shakeup in my life in American healthcare like this. You are just rocking. It's fantastic.Mark Cuban (36:37):Everybody out there that's watching, check out www.costplusdrugs.com, check out Cost Plus Marketplace, which is business.costplusdrugs.com and just audit everything. What I'm trying to do is say, okay, if it's 1955 and we're starting healthcare all over again, how would we do it? And really just keep it simple. Look to where the risk is and remove the risk where possible. And then it comes down to who do you trust and make sure you trust but verify. Making sure there aren't doctors or systems that are outliers and making sure that there aren't companies that are outliers or patients rather that are outliers. And so, I think there's a path there. It's not nearly as difficult, it's just starting them with corporations, getting those CEOs to get educated and act in their own best interest.Eric Topol (37:32):Well, you're showing us the way. No question. So thanks so much for joining, and we'll be following this with really deep interest because you're moving at high velocity, and thank you.**************************************************Thank you for reading, listening and subscribing to Ground Truths.If you found this fun and informative please share it!All content on Ground Truths‚Äîits newsletters, analyses, and podcasts, are free, open-access.Paid subscriptions are voluntary.

Trump one, the Harris v. Trump one‚ÄîI heard a rumor while in the MSNBC green room. Mark Cuban, the former owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Shark Tank stalwart, and indefatigable Democratic surrogate, had been asked to submit VP vetting papers by the Harris campaign.I never was able to nail down the rumor‚Äîuntil now. In an interview Thursday, Cuban confirmed that he was, indeed, asked. He also said that he declined the offer because his vetting book would be too long and it wasn‚Äôt worth the trouble for someone who, in his own admission, would not be ‚Äúvery good as the number-two person.‚ÄùBeyond raising the tantalizing possibility of what the 2024 campaign could have been, Cuban also addressed a wide variety of other matters: his plan to fix health care, the Trump report card, AI, crypto, Nikola Jokic, and whether there‚Äôs a chance he might try to run for president himself in 2028.Check out the preview clip and tune in tomorrow for the full interview.

Mark Cuban,"""Mark Cuban""",0QcpNqRiu3hIYFX7Jjfu3E,Mark Cuban‚Äôs disruption formula: from streaming and healthcare to AI‚Äôs next wave,"Steve Jobs once said, ‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs a remix.‚Äù And that‚Äôs a philosophy that Mark Cuban has taken to heart, building an entire entrepreneurial and investment career on that simple belief. The real opportunity, Cuban says, lies in spotting patterns others miss and turning them into billion-dollar disruptions.  On today's episode of Equity, Cuban joined Rebecca Bellan to discuss his decades-long strategy of betting on technologies before they go mainstream, from his early investments in local area networks and streaming services to his current healthcare and AI ventures. But Cuban's real insight isn't just about picking winners. It's about understanding why most people building in AI today are missing the point entirely.  Cuban delivered a stark warning about the current AI gold rush: while everyone's using ChatGPT, almost no one (including Fortune 500 CEOs) knows how to integrate AI into their actual businesses. His take? Forget the hype. The real money is in helping small- and medium-sized businesses figure out how to use the AI tools that already exist.  Listen to the full episode to hear:      How Cuban identified disruptive opportunities in LANs, streaming, and HD television before they became obvious.       Why he thinks current AI ""isn't smart,"" and why that limitation could be its strength as a business tool.       The upcoming regulatory battles that will determine AI's future around IP protection, training data access, and the U.S.-China competition.       Inside Cuban's latest venture, Cost Plus Drugs, expanding from transparent pricing to manufacturing.       Cuban's prediction that AI-savvy graduates will become the most in-demand employees across every industry.     As always, Equity will be back Friday. Don‚Äôt miss it!

Pat and Mark chat about the NBA continuing its season, what he‚Äôs heard on the conference calls about opening sports back up and when he anticipates fans returning to stadiums. They also chat about whether or not Mark has any interest in buying any other professional sports teams, if he‚Äôs at all considering a presidential run, and if he would‚Äôve done everything in his power to keep Tom Brady if he was Robert Kraft (00:00:40-24:14). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk with AJ coming to us live from a closet in Jordy Nelson‚Äôs house. Pat and AJ discuss the Mark Cuban interview and what it means for fans coming back into stadiums, whether or not the NFL should try and construct a tier system for quarterback‚Äôs that doesn‚Äôt count against the team‚Äôs salary cap, Pat and AJ each recount some old hunting stories, give their thoughts on Pete Rose, and react to the news (that ended up being BS) that Dak Prescott was reportedly offered a 5 year, $175 million contract by the Cowboys (24:16-2:04:25). Lastly, 3x Super Bowl Champion, 3x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, member of the Patriots‚Äô All-2000‚Äôs team and 50th Anniversary Team, Matt Light, joins the show. Pat and Matt discuss the raffle he is conducting to send fans to the Bucs/Saints game next year, what he expects Tom Brady to bring to the Tampa Bay locker room, his thoughts on Jarrett Stidham and why no one from the Patriots organization has had any glowing reviews for him, and Tom Brady requiring his center to wear a specific towel to eliminate any sweat transfer (2:04:27-2:18:55).

This show from last year was one of the most popular episodes of the past year. And it‚Äôs also extremely relevant right now, given all of the PBM (pharmacy benefit manager) goings-on, as well as ongoing litigation like the J&J lawsuit, etc. Listen to the show with Julie Selesnick (EP428) for more on that one. Joined by Ferrin Williams from Scripta, Cuban stresses the importance for CEOs and CFOs of self-insured companies to get actively involved in their healthcare plans to avoid overpaying. The conversation tackles the opaque practices of PBMs, the financialized nature of the healthcare industry, and introduces Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drugs model which aims for transparency and cost reduction. Key topics also include the potential legal implications for employers, the importance of trust in healthcare transactions, and the real-world savings and benefits achievable with greater involvement and transparency in healthcare management. What do all of these numbers have in common: $140,000, $3 million, $35 million, and $3 billion? These are all actual examples of how much employers, unions, and some public entities saved on healthcare benefits for themselves and their employees. The roadmap to saving 25% on pharmacy spend and/or 15% on total cost of care in ways that improve employee health and satisfaction always begins when one thing happens. There‚Äôs one vital first step. That first step is CEOs and/or CFOs or their equivalents roll up their sleeves and get involved in healthcare benefits.¬† === LINKS === üîó ¬†Show Notes with all mentioned links: ¬† https://cc-lnk.com/Encore418 üîó ¬†Healthcare Industry Acronyms and Terms https://relentlesshealthvalue.com/healthcare-acronymns ‚úâÔ∏è ¬†Enjoy this podcast?

Elon Musk VS Mark Cuban to Win the Election,"This week, we took over a high school homecoming, and let me tell you, after hearing about the DJ disaster they had last year, I knew I had to swoop in and save the day. Last year‚Äôs guy played all the wrong songs, capped the night with Mamba‚Äîwhich, I mean, why? So, they canned him and called in the pro (yours truly).  The kids? They had a blast. I‚Äôm talking, Unwritten by Natasha Bedingfield brought the house down. You know you‚Äôve hit the right note when an entire room of teenagers collectively loses their minds two seconds into a song. Then came Since U Been Gone by Kelly Clarkson, because obviously, you can‚Äôt go wrong with early 2000s anthems at a 2024 homecoming. These kids? They get it. Who knew?  But, let‚Äôs get to the meat of this episode. We‚Äôre in the final stretch, people‚Äîthe 2024 election is less than 20 days away. And let‚Äôs be real, nobody has any idea who they‚Äôre voting for. We‚Äôve got Zaddy Trumpets out here spinning his usual ‚Äúpolicies‚Äù (read: nonsense). He‚Äôs supposed to be answering questions at a town hall but ends up playing DJ with his summer playlist while people literally pass out from heat exhaustion. Instead of answering questions like a normal candidate, he‚Äôs out here doing the YMCA for 40 minutes straight. I mean, what are we doing?  But the highlight? Trump‚Äôs diving into crypto now‚Äîyep, you heard me. He‚Äôs promoting some sketchy token called ‚ÄúLiberty Financial.‚Äù Look, if you‚Äôre feeling adventurous, go ahead and dump your entire savings into it, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it (not financial advice, wink, wink). The best part? You can‚Äôt even withdraw your money until the ‚Äúscheme‚Äù‚ÄîI mean, system‚Äîdecides you can. Yeah, read the fine print, folks.  Meanwhile, Elon Musk is jumping on the Trump train, donating millions and becoming Trump‚Äôs new bestie after they were practically enemies a few weeks ago. Musk is now campaigning in Pennsylvania like he‚Äôs the freaking Director of Government Efficiency, which is a real job title Trump invented just for him. Honestly, the whole thing is starting to feel like a crossover episode of The Apprentice and Shark Tank.  And if all that wasn‚Äôt enough, we‚Äôve got Ice Cube dropping new music‚Äîyes, that Ice Cube. The man who hasn‚Äôt rapped in forever decided now is the time. I don‚Äôt think anyone‚Äôs listening to it, but hey, props to him for trying. Exhibit‚Äôs also crawling out of retirement with a new album on a record label run by‚Ä¶ wait for it‚Ä¶ Conor McGregor. Yes, because when I think ‚Äúmusic mogul,‚Äù I totally think ‚ÄúMMA fighter.‚Äù What are we doing?  Oh, and shoutout to Dasani. They‚Äôre back with a new formula‚Äînow without salt. Yes, that‚Äôs right. The selling point for water is that it finally doesn‚Äôt have salt in it. What a groundbreaking concept. Welcome to 2024, people.  That‚Äôs it for this week.

This brand is also well-loved by billionaires, more notably value investor Warren Buffett and Shark Tank‚Äôs Mark Cuban.¬† You might have by now guessed that I am talking about International Dairy Queen, a company known globally for its soft-serve treats like the Blizzard and the Dilly Bar.¬† Founded in 1940, International Dairy Queen or the parent company of American Dairy Queen Corporation and Dairy Queen Canada has grown to a global quick service restaurant player.¬† The firm is also famously known as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Warren Buffett‚Äôs Berkshire Hathaway, having been acquired in 1998.¬† Currently, the firm develops, licenses and services a system of over 7,700 Dairy Queen restaurants over 20 countries. But the firm doesn‚Äôt seem to stop there and appears to be on a charm offensive to expand internationally.¬† For one thing, the firm had in 2022, through American Dairy Queen Corporation and private equity firm FountainVest Partners, unveiled plans to open up 600 Dairy Queen restaurants in China by the end of the decade.¬† Then came July 2024, when International Dairy Queen teamed up with FountainVest Partner‚Äôs franchise ownership company CFB Group to open what‚Äôs said then to be the first DQ Blizzard & Burgers restaurant in Shanghai in Asia. So what was the rationale behind the firm‚Äôs aggressive expansion moves? And how far will the company‚Äôs international business bolster sales as global trade tensions and tariffs weigh on consumption in the US? Beyond international expansion, International Dairy Queen is also said to be placing a stronger emphasis on hot food, versus the dessert treats it was once famous for. But why is this the case?

Mark Cuban,"""Mark Cuban""",42yFm1Xp3Q6zyiO6pfrAm5,Mark Cuban's China Silence: When Billionaires Can't Speak Freely,"Send us a textMark Cuban's Twitter exchange with Ted Cruz reveals a startling truth about modern hypocrisy: those who loudly condemn domestic issues often fall silent when Chinese money is at stake. When challenged to speak about China's human rights abuses, Cuban couldn't deliver the same bold statements he makes about American ""systemic racism.""This pattern of selective outrage extends beyond celebrities to institutions. Redwood City, California approved a Black Lives Matter street mural but quickly removed it when someone requested a ""MAGA 2020"" message in the same space. Their sudden concern about ""traffic hazards"" appeared only when political neutrality became necessary. Meanwhile, Red Bull demonstrated a different approach by firing executives focused on social justice initiatives rather than core business objectives ‚Äì showing companies can resist internal political pressure.The podcast explores how ""the walls are closing in"" on multiple fronts: Durham's investigation into the Russia collusion hoax appears to be negotiating guilty pleas, Joe Biden has been formally named in a Ukrainian criminal investigation, and China faces multiple crises including massive flooding, bank runs, and international scrutiny of their treatment of Uyghur Muslims. BBC footage showing blindfolded prisoners being loaded onto trains has forced Chinese officials into uncomfortable positions when confronted with evidence.What connects these seemingly disparate topics? The concept of ideological consistency. Those claiming moral authority must apply principles universally ‚Äì not selectively based on financial or political convenience. ""The shoe has to fit on both feet,"" as the host explains. Unlike authoritarian systems that restrict information, America's strength lies in open dialogue and the competition of ideas in the public square.Ready to see through the hypocrisy?

Cuban, a high-profile supporter of Harris and a well-known entrepreneur, has been actively involved in campaign efforts for the Vice President. He highlights Trump's unique ability to communicate with and energize a broad base, acknowledging that the former president's appeal lies in his straightforward messaging and simplicity.During a recent event, Cuban remarked on the shortcomings of Harris's Democratic counterparts, citing their inability to match Trump's connection with their constituencies. ""They can't sell worth s---,"" Cuban quipped, emphasizing the importance of clear and relatable messaging in successful political campaigns. His comments underscore a critical challenge for the Democratic Party and Harris's own campaign: the necessity of enhancing their messaging strategies to better resonate with the American public.As Vice President Harris prepares for the 2024 presidential race, Cuban's remarks offer a pointed appraisal of the current political landscape. They reflect a broader sentiment among some Democratic strategists who believe that refining communication tactics could be key to countering Trump's influence and gaining traction with voters. Cuban's involvement as a surrogate indicates a strategic effort by Harris‚Äôs campaign to leverage diverse voices and experiences to appeal to a wider audience.In addition to discussions about campaign strategy, Cuban's observations serve as a reminder of the evolving dynamics within American politics. The upcoming election promises to be fiercely contested, with candidates needing to not only address policy concerns but also master the art of political communication. For Harris, harnessing this insight could be crucial in distinguishing herself from both Democratic rivals and Republican opponents.Ultimately, the effectiveness of Harris's campaign may hinge on her ability to crystallize a compelling narrative that can compete with the simpler, potent messaging exhibited by Trump. As discussions continue within Democratic circles, the insights offered by surrogates like Cuban could play a significant role in shaping the strategies that define the 2024 election cycle.This content was created in partnership and with the help of Artificial Intelligence AI",https://open.spotify.com/episode/76dsWFolHlj5G3rRKwDDxy,2025-02-25,2YAjmiAEy6fVC96gZ3Gu4N,Kamala Harris Daily News Tracker,Inception Point Ai,1761323027.5322108

Mark Cuban,"""Mark Cuban""",2fDwrSYjdGpHeynJs5kd5J,Mark Cuban Cuts Through the Noise on Raging Moderates: A Pragmatist's Call for Political Reform and Innovation,"Billionaire entrepreneur, NBA team owner, and outspoken business mogul Mark Cuban is the next guest on the political podcast ‚ÄúRaging Moderates,‚Äù where he joins to talk entrepreneurship, politics, healthcare, and why he‚Äôs staying out of the 2024 presidential race ‚Äî for now. Cuban, known for his candid takes and appearances on Shark Tank, dishes with hosts Ryan Clancy and Brian Stryker about the failures of both parties, the importance of tech innovation, and the danger of extremism. In classic Cuban fashion, he doesn‚Äôt hold back, declaring, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got two parties taking turns driving the country into a ditch.‚Äù Key Points:  Mark Cuban makes a guest appearance on the Raging Moderates ‚Äî a podcast aimed at political centrism with humor and a touch of realism.  Cuban critiques both political parties, saying neither represents the majority of Americans: ‚ÄúThe American people are in the middle. Politicians? They‚Äôre not even trying to meet us there.‚Äù  On the 2024 election, Cuban confirms he‚Äôs not running for president but stays vocal about political reform.  He champions technology and entrepreneurship as tools for equity, especially in healthcare, mentioning his Cost Plus Drugs company aimed at lowering prescription drug prices.  Cuban warns against political extremism, stating social media incentivizes the loudest, not the wisest.  Hosts Ryan Clancy and Brian Stryker highlight the growing appeal of a centrist voice in an increasingly polarized political landscape.   Why it matters: Cuban‚Äôs conversation is a refreshing detour from party-line politics, offering a pragmatist‚Äôs call to action in an age of division. And yes, he still believes businesses can be a force for good. Bonus: Cuban's company, Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company, is mentioned as a practical example of business-driven health equity, offering low-cost medications directly to consumers online.Link to Article",https://open.spotify.com/episode/2fDwrSYjdGpHeynJs5kd5J,2025-04-11,7kaRmk3R5jizHxRhRy1zAc,jawbreaker.io,jawbreaker.io,1761323027.5476313

But those who do tend to have an edge. If you're curious, if you love to learn, you're going to do pretty well. But how do you find those people when they're kids and how do you try to just capture their imagination and get them excited about the technology? That's why we started the bootcamp.‚Äù‚ÄúI wanted to make technology accessible to people who otherwise couldn't get it. It doesn't matter what you look like, who you are, what your ethnicity is, what your background is. There are just going to be people who don't have access. I wanted to open that door for them. I'm a big believer in diversity, and that when you look at places where other people aren't, that's when you find brilliance that can change the world.‚Äù‚ÄúThe path to least resistance to learning AI is simple. All you‚Äôve got to do is use it. You can use it in ways that you can‚Äôt possibly imagine. You can learn how to use large language models to start your own programming and teach yourself how to do it. The sky's the limit. Better way to put it, there is literally next to nothing you can't teach yourself using a large language model. You can even train and educate the model. It‚Äôs a virtuous cycle.

It‚Äôs a lesson this natural-born businessman learned from his father and took to heart at an early age. This episode begins with a trip back to Mark‚Äôs early years and explores how he made his first million (and then billion) ‚Äî and why he continues to be driven by the pursuit of freedom that comes with having control over your own schedule. He also talks about some of his productivity habits, including why 40 unread emails is his limit, and how he uses Muck Rack Alerts to keep track of his press mentions. As someone who‚Äôs not shy about talking to the press but who also knows how valuable time is, Mark offers this advice for CEOs: ‚ÄúSome of the best time that you can spend is getting to know people that cover and write about your industry.‚Äù Listen in to hear Mark‚Äôs journey from a self-described ‚Äúlousy employee‚Äù to billionaire Shark who‚Äôs accumulated significant wealth in both time and money.Thank you to our sponsor SteadyMD.

Mark Cuban? Are there Better Ways to Impact Politics?,"The Best Paragraph I've Read:Perot was the most successful third-party candidate in modern history. You helped run his campaigns and build the Reform Party. What advice do you have for Musk when it comes to building a new party?My basic advice is: Go to rehab and then focus on creating a new political party from a position of seriousness, not of anger, not of retribution, not of retaliation. It‚Äôs a very significant mission. You‚Äôre going to be asking millions of people to volunteer, to assist you to accomplish that and to support your activities, and they need a serious leader, not somebody who‚Äôs flamboyant.This paragraph comes from an interview on Politico.com.

I actually think that is very limiting thinking because yes, of course, Mark Cuban and other people at his level have larger teams of people to get stuff done, but he also has a tremendous amount more than all the rest of us have to look after. I mean, he owns the Dallas Mavericks, he owns Landmark Theaters, he's a TV star co-hosting, investing on Shark Tank. He's written books, he's invested in and is guiding dozens of start-ups and tech companies. He's always being interviewed on TV, on the news programs, on the financial programs. He's a husband. He's a father with three young daughters. This guy has responsibilities and obligations and things to watch at a magnitude that are much greater than most of us can ever imagine.  Yet, given all of that, he got back to me faster than any other person that I reached out to. I probably reached out to over 800 people. Almost 300 got back in touch with me, most of them within a day or two. Mark Cuban responded to me in 61 minutes. I was shocked. What is Mark Cubans advice?

This brand is also well-loved by billionaires, more notably value investor Warren Buffett and Shark Tank‚Äôs Mark Cuban.¬† You might have by now guessed that I am talking about International Dairy Queen, a company known globally for its soft-serve treats like the Blizzard and the Dilly Bar.¬† Founded in 1940, International Dairy Queen or the parent company of American Dairy Queen Corporation and Dairy Queen Canada has grown to a global quick service restaurant player.¬† The firm is also famously known as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Warren Buffett‚Äôs Berkshire Hathaway, having been acquired in 1998.¬† Currently, the firm develops, licenses and services a system of over 7,700 Dairy Queen restaurants over 20 countries. But the firm doesn‚Äôt seem to stop there and appears to be on a charm offensive to expand internationally.¬† For one thing, the firm had in 2022, through American Dairy Queen Corporation and private equity firm FountainVest Partners, unveiled plans to open up 600 Dairy Queen restaurants in China by the end of the decade.¬† Then came July 2024, when International Dairy Queen teamed up with FountainVest Partner‚Äôs franchise ownership company CFB Group to open what‚Äôs said then to be the first DQ Blizzard & Burgers restaurant in Shanghai in Asia. So what was the rationale behind the firm‚Äôs aggressive expansion moves? And how far will the company‚Äôs international business bolster sales as global trade tensions and tariffs weigh on consumption in the US? Beyond international expansion, International Dairy Queen is also said to be placing a stronger emphasis on hot food, versus the dessert treats it was once famous for. But why is this the case?

Described in this article, they focus on high numbers of channels using rapid, continuous, and repetitive messages that lack commitment to consistency. Like using a rapid fire shotgun as opposed to a precise sniper rifle. It uses text, photo, video and audio on multi-channels and in high-volumes. They employ huge armies of internet trolls and hackers to execute their strategies. According to a former paid Russian Internet troll, the trolls are on duty 24 hours a day, in 12-hour shifts, and each has a daily quota of 135 posted comments of at least 200 characters. Has this strategy become a pervasive source of information in America? Is it possible to discern truth from lie in our day and age? How?Mark Cuban recently announced that he is selling part of his ownership in the Dallas Mavericks to Miriam Adelson for $2 billion. What was not as widely reported is that this is part of a larger plan that Cuban announced last year to build a new arena in the middle of a Vegas-style hotel and casino resort complex in Dallas. But gambling is illegal in Texas. This is why Cuban is selling majority ownership to the president of Sands Casino. The Adelson family are big donors to the Texas governor and Lt. Governor and this infusion of cash will help pave the way for a campaign to legalize gambling in the state of Texas. If Cuban can get the law changed, he and Adelson will have played a large role in writing the laws that will regulate a new industry in Texas. Is this another example of how billionaires exploit the system to give them an unfair advantage in our capitalist system?¬†Big Question: In October GC, Elder Pingree of the Seventy talked about the difference between truth, doctrine, and policy. He said when seeking truth, it helps to understand the difference between doctrine and policy. Doctrine refers to eternal truths, such as the nature of the Godhead, the plan of salvation, and Jesus Christ's atoning sacrifice. Policy is the application of doctrine based on current circumstances. Policy helps us administer the church in an orderly way. He went on to say that doctrine never changes, but policy adjusts from time to time. He also said that there is danger in confusing policy and doctrine. We have talked before about activism towards the church. But if policy is simply the application of doctrine based on current circumstances, doesn't that suggest that it might be appropriate for members of the Church to engage in some lobbying or activism to change policies? When is such behavior appropriate?",https://open.spotify.com/episode/4k1twKA7xNTWW9wD093CP7,2023-12-06,3rYqCceFZKFyqbaMwA8cWf,The Latter Day Lens,Shawn & Matt,1761323032.376102
Mark Cuban,"""Mark Cuban""",6fsVzKUNTg2mZoIMd6axIi,Elon Musk kan de datarijkdom van Twitter gebruiken om een 'virtuele Elon' op basis van AI te maken ‚Äì dat vindt techondernemer Mark Cuban 'best wel eng',"De Amerikaanse ondernemer en miljardair Mark Cuban denkt dat de datarijkdom van Twitter Ielon Musk kan helpen om de strijd aan te gaan met OpenA I, de maker van de populaire vraagbaak ChatGPT, en andere bedrijven die kunstmatige intelligentie ontwikkelen.Vorige maand kondigde Musk aan een nieuwe startup voor artificial intelligence op te richten.Hij noemt het bedrijf TruthGPT, in een sneer naar de software van OpenA I.Cuban zei donderdag op Twitter, het socialmediaplatform dat Musk vorig jaar kocht, dat hij gelooft dat de A I-race zal draaien om welke bedrijven de beste data bezitten.Musk kan 17 jaar aan tweets gebruiken om een taalmodel te trainen en zo te concurreren met 'de grote drie', schreef Cuban op Twitter.Met dat laatste verwijst hij naar de techreuzen Google, Meta en Microsoft, dat samenwerkt met OpenA I.    https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1659195049551499274    Volgens Cuban kan Musk zijn eigen tweets gebruiken voor het ontwikkelen van een 'virtuele Elon'.Dat vindt hij 'redelijk cool', maar ook 'best wel eng'.   'Het wordt interessant om te zien wat Elon ermee doet'. Dat schrijft Cuban in een e-mail aan Insider.   'Iedereen kan een virtuele versie van zichzelf cre√´ren', legt Cuban uit in zijn e-mail.Je kan hiervoor de publiekelijk beschikbare taalmodellen trainen met je eigen persoonlijke data.   Twitter bezit waardevolle data voor A I    Het unieke aan Twitter, volgens Cuban, is dat het beschikt over een enorme hoeveelheid aan diverse en waardevolle data die gebruikt kan worden voor het trainen van A I-modellen en die niet gemakkelijk elders te verkrijgen is.¬†   Of hij daar gelijk in heeft, moet nog worden bezien.De tweets staan immers online en kunnen dus ook door andere partijen dan het sociale platform zelf worden gebruikt als data.Sterker nog, Musk dreigde vorige maand Microsoft hierom voor de rechter te slepen.De softwaregigant zou illegaal tweets hebben gebruikt om zijn A I-modellen te trainen.Eind vorig jaar verloor OpenA I toegang tot de data van Twitter.Het A I-bedrijf gebruikte de tweets, die het verkreeg via een licentie, voor het trainen van vraagbaak ChatGPT.Naar verluidt vond Musk dat OpenA I niet genoeg betaalde voor de toegang.Net als veel andere techondernemers lijkt Cuban met argusogen naar de ontwikkeling van kunstmatige intelligentie te kijken.In een andere tweet op donderdag schreef de miljardair dat de technologie 'gevaarlijke mensen slim maakt' en dat er 'onbedoelde gevolgen zullen zijn'.

For others, it‚Äôs a feeling of happiness and fulfillment. And for many others, it‚Äôs somewhere in between these two ideas. There is no right or wrong definition of success; thus, we must evaluate it holistically before driving ourselves towards any version of it. On today‚Äôs episode of The Tai Lopez Show, we are joined by the billionaire, Mark Cuban, to discuss what it takes to reach his level of success. As a young 20-something, after discovering that he was skilled at technology, Cuban founded his first company, MicroSolutions. Since then, he‚Äôs gone on to forging a net worth of over $3 billion. He is the star of Shark Tank, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, the author of How to Win at the Sport of Business, and a source of knowledge for all of us to tap into. Don‚Äôt forget!

Mark‚Äôs curiosity and knack for business lead him towards plenty of exciting ventures, from starring on Shark Tank to owning the Dallas Mavericks. Taking us back to the beginning, Mark shares how he stumbled into the idea of local area networking back in the 80s, all the way up to selling broadcast.com to Yahoo! Inc. in 1999. According to Mark, today‚Äôs crypto community closely resembles the ‚Äúgold rush‚Äù felt in 1999. Now, he predicts it‚Äôs all going to boil down to applications, implications, and integrations. A day of reckoning will come, and we both agree that utility will win in the long run. As a philanthropist, Mark also reflected on the play-to-earn model that crypto follows and the potential to create a similar ecosystem within philanthropy. Coming from someone who's always been in the middle of the creator economy, this episode is a great look at the past, present, and future of innovation.

Mark Cuban,"""Mark Cuban""",7hUkocaaCOapEK8ZMPMogz,Reinventing Pharmacy: Mark Cuban Says Trust Is Missing Across Healthcare. Here‚Äôs What He‚Äôs Doing About It,"Mark Cuban built a career disrupting industries and creating new ones. Now, his sights are set on healthcare. There‚Äôs no secret ingredient to Mark‚Äôs success. As the world sees very publicly on Shark Tank, his style is the opposite of keeping secrets. It‚Äôs based on providing respectful, but direct, honest and unvarnished opinions. He‚Äôs bringing that style to healthcare in order to inject what he says the industry is lacking most. Trust.To kick-off a series of Healthcare is Hard podcast episodes that will dive deep into all aspects of reinventing the pharmacy space, Keith Figlioli sat down with Mark to discuss his vision and strategy behind Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company, and many other healthcare-related topics.With Cost Plus Drug Company, Mark is bringing radical transparency to what he says is the most opaque industry he‚Äôs ever been involved in. He‚Äôs doing it by pricing every single product the same way ‚Äì the cost of a drug, plus 15% markup, plus pharmacy fee (if any), plus shipping ‚Äì and publishing these details for everyone to see.Through this model, Mark aims reduce costs and improve access to drugs, while rebuilding trust in the industry. With 2,400+ drugs now available, he‚Äôs off to a fast start and talked to Keith about other evolving elements of the business including wholesale operations for providers, partnerships with grocery and pharmacy chains, and more.Some of the other topics Keith and Mark discussed include:The Netflix model for specialty drugs. With revolutionary precision medicine coming to market at high costs that can reach millions of dollars per treatment, how will employers and consumers afford them? According to Mark, that‚Äôs the wrong question. He‚Äôs looking at the challenge through the manufacturer‚Äôs lens, asking how much they‚Äôve invested in drug development and at what dollar value can they make reasonable returns. He discussed conversations he‚Äôs having with manufacturers about creating subscription services that could cover a wide range of high-cost, specialty drugs.Transparent, direct contracting. Mark now self-insures his employees and their family members, contracts directly with providers on payment rates, and ‚Äì following the Cost Plus philosophy ‚Äì publishes everything for the world to see. He shared a personal story that helped lead him to this decision where he paid a provider directly when his son needed an X-ray and realized it was a fraction of the cost of agreed upon rates with his insurance company. He talked about how this decision cuts other costs while improving employee wellness, removing burdens on HR, and ultimately helping providers by removing the risk they take and helping them get paid faster.¬†Millions of AI models. Mark is a big believer that there will be millions of AI models and everyone will have one. He says 100 years from now you‚Äôll be able to ask him questions through a model trained on all his emails and data. But AI in healthcare will be more segmented. He talks about how there‚Äôs no way leading research hospitals with respected brands will feed their data into one large language model unless they get paid an extreme amount of money. They may even stop publishing ‚Äúanything and everything‚Äù to prevent their research from being ingested into someone else‚Äôs model.To hear Mark and Keith discuss these topics and more, listen to this episode of Healthcare is Hard: A Podcast for Insiders.",https://open.spotify.com/episode/7hUkocaaCOapEK8ZMPMogz,2024-03-21,4iJomWvEY3OgERDoShZh0W,Healthcare is Hard: A Podcast for Insiders,LRVHealth,1761323034.4566398

Chapo Trap House can certainly boast a wildly devoted fan base (and a not insignificant degree of media influence), but their audience is roughly half the size of Kulinski‚Äôs.While Secular Talk might be more likely to be looped in with the progressive networks around Air America and Pacifica alums like Sam Seder than the more resolutely socialist world, Kulinski‚Äôs fiery rhetoric, razor-sharp class instincts, and knack for withering takedowns sets him apart from his peers. Judging by his rhetoric alone, he‚Äôs closer to a Eugene Debs than a Chris Hayes.But unlike Hayes, Amy Goodman, or his friend Cenk Uygur of The Young Turks ‚Äî who began airing Secular Talk on his web network seven years ago ‚Äî the thirty-two-year-old Kulinski is virtually invisible in the mainstream media. Despite his enormous fan base, his show has never once been mentioned in the obligatory trend pieces on ‚Äúthe Millennial Left‚Äù pumped out by the prestige media. Nor has Kulinski‚Äôs name ever popped up at all in the New York Times, Vox, the New Yorker, New York Magazine, or the Washington Post, despite his leading role in cofounding Justice Democrats, the organization widely credited with sweeping Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the rest of ‚Äúthe Squad‚Äù to power.Just last week, his Wikipedia page was deleted. The reason? ‚ÄúThere is very simply no [reliable source] coverage of this person,‚Äù according to one moderator. In new media, he‚Äôs king ‚Äî the Sean Hannity of the Berniecrat left. In old media, he‚Äôs nobody.I suspect there are a few reasons for that. There is nothing ‚Äúcool‚Äù about Kulinski‚Äôs show. (As a friend put it, ‚Äú‚ÄòWelcome to Secular Talk‚Äô sounds like something you‚Äôd hear on Egyptian radio.‚Äù) His no-nonsense social-democratic politics won‚Äôt get him much cred with the Full Communism crowd. He records his show not in Brooklyn or Los Angeles, but in a studio he built himself in his modest Westchester home. His hair is too groomed and his taste in clothes too preppy to qualify as ‚ÄúDirtbag Left.‚Äù Nor has he ever attended an n+1 release party. ‚ÄúNot only have I not attended one,‚Äù he says, ‚ÄúI have no idea what that means.‚ÄùAnd yet he‚Äôs astonishingly plugged-in for a young man in the suburbs. Wondering how Sanders ended up on the Joe Rogan Experience? Kulinski, a frequent guest on Rogan‚Äôs wildly popular show, introduced them. ‚ÄúYou make the most sense to me,‚Äù Rogan told Kulinski on a recent episode. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a normal person.‚ÄùMuch like Sanders himself, Kulinski‚Äôs show has a massive audience that just doesn‚Äôt compute with our media‚Äôs understanding of ‚Äúwhat the kids want‚Äù or even ‚Äúwhat the left-wing kids want.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs probably for the best ‚Äî the very woke and very WASP-ish decorum haunting much of the media world is nowhere to be found in Secular Talk. ‚ÄúCorporate Democrats over-focus on identity as a trick to divert you from the issues that unite us all ‚Äî class issues,‚Äù he said on a recent episode. ‚ÄúThat Raytheon decided they don‚Äôt hate gays or trans people ‚Äî frankly, I don‚Äôt really give a shit what their take on that is...""Read More Here!: https://jacobinmag.com/2020/03/kyle-kulinski-bernie-bros-secular-talk-joe-rogan-youtube #KyleKulinski #SecularTalk¬†",https://open.spotify.com/episode/3x8J9GhW2NsCzKTJMFgG1R,2023-11-29,5OGGuJD0txpWV0QOETTcjU,The Kyle Kulinski Show,Kyle Kulinski,1761323035.3293018

Today, we're honored to have Mark Cuban, a name synonymous with relentless innovation and forward-thinking entrepreneurship. From owning the Dallas Mavericks to his investments on Shark Tank, Cuban has now turned his focus towards a venture that's close to our hearts - healthcare.In this insightful episode, Mark Cuban delves into the inception of Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company (MCCPDC), sharing why he chose to step into the pharmaceutical space and how he plans to tackle the egregious pricing in the pharmacy industry. Cuban discusses the transparent business model of publishing costs, adding a minimal markup, and how this approach is set to revolutionize how we think about drug pricing.Beyond the business model, Cuban opens up about the bigger picture - trust in the healthcare system. He articulates why trust is the foundational product of MCCPDC and how transparency can rebuild the broken bridges between consumers and the pharmaceutical supply chain.Furthermore, Cuban doesn't shy away from discussing the broader healthcare landscape, including the roles of insurance companies, PBMs (Pharmacy Benefit Managers), and the potential of direct contracting to enhance employer-based healthcare plans.This episode is not just about the mechanics of a new pharmaceutical company; it's a deep dive into the ethos of Mark Cuban as an entrepreneur committed to making a tangible difference in the world. His candid reflections on healthcare, business, and life offer invaluable insights for anyone looking to make an impact.Join us on The Healthcare Trailblazers as we explore the journey of Mark Cuban and the ambitious goal of MCCPDC to ensure that fair drug pricing becomes a reality, not just a lofty ideal.

Either the job has drifted from what they'd initially thought, or maybe they're a leader at work, but they're passed over for promotions or raises. There are many reasons why people feel the malaise of a job that doesn't work anymore, but the effect is nearly always the same. Either you stagger through the work, wasting your life, or you dream about early retirement. What if there was another answer? What if the job that lights you up is actually out there? You need to know the tools to go find it. That's what Tessa Woods gifts us on today's show. You'll learn how to throw off the ennui and find meaning at work by either rebooting your current career or finding a new job elsewhere. We'll talk about how to engage in effective networking, how to assert yourself as a leader in your field, and why changing fields isn't a bad idea--even if you're an older worker. While many of us think that we wouldn't qualify for jobs against seasoned pros who've already had experience in the given area, Tessa shares how and why employers often want someone with a fresh perspective. You have to know how to sell your strengths, and we'll share some keys today.  In our headline segment, we'll review how Mark Cuban saved his fortune from disaster when everyone else lost money in the 2000-2002 tech wreck. We'll share the tools he used and how it all went down. Plus we'll answer the question: should YOU also use this strategy to avoid losses? It's a great question, and we tackle it head-on! We'll cover options, market declines, and the financial planning reasons Cuban executed this strategy.

One of the headline stories is his prominent role in a nationwide campaign promoting dyslexia awareness. According to Amber Sound FM and multiple other outlets, Branson declared that dyslexia is a superpower, emphasizing that thinking differently is something to be celebrated. He was front and center at the campaign‚Äôs launch, using his own success to inspire young entrepreneurs who might struggle in traditional environments. This movement received significant media attention, especially as Branson highlighted dyslexic entrepreneurs and called for a broader understanding of neurodiversity. Minutehack and Crags Radio also noted his view that overcoming educational barriers shaped his character and business acumen.On the business front, Branson is lending not just his name but his physical presence to the Dream Machine event arriving in Milton Keynes from September 2nd to 4th. According to Business MK, the event invites members of the public to pitch big ideas directly to world-class entrepreneurs, including Branson himself. It‚Äôs classic Richard‚Äîturning the spotlight to the next generation of risk-takers and idea-makers, perpetuating his legacy as a champion of innovation.Always good for a headline, Branson stirred up social media and lighthearted controversy by pouring water on Mark Cuban‚Äôs face in what appears to be a playful, impromptu moment. While the incident, reported by MVSU and picking up chatter online, was clearly staged in good spirit, it‚Äôs being shared widely‚Äîyet another reminder that Branson is rarely content to fade into the background and always knows how to keep things lively in both boardrooms and media feeds.He hasn‚Äôt shied away from big-picture topics either. In recent interviews, as reported by AOL, Branson vocally criticized Donald Trump‚Äôs trade policies, branding them erratic and unpredictable and arguing that they have harmful global repercussions. Comments like these ensure his profile remains high not just in business, but in global political discourse as well.To sum it up, Richard Branson is everywhere this week‚Äîfrom education advocacy and entrepreneurial support to headline-grabbing moments and political critique.

This brand is also well-loved by billionaires, more notably value investor Warren Buffett and Shark Tank‚Äôs Mark Cuban.¬† You might have by now guessed that I am talking about International Dairy Queen, a company known globally for its soft-serve treats like the Blizzard and the Dilly Bar.¬† Founded in 1940, International Dairy Queen or the parent company of American Dairy Queen Corporation and Dairy Queen Canada has grown to a global quick service restaurant player.¬† The firm is also famously known as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Warren Buffett‚Äôs Berkshire Hathaway, having been acquired in 1998.¬† Currently, the firm develops, licenses and services a system of over 7,700 Dairy Queen restaurants over 20 countries. But the firm doesn‚Äôt seem to stop there and appears to be on a charm offensive to expand internationally.¬† For one thing, the firm had in 2022, through American Dairy Queen Corporation and private equity firm FountainVest Partners, unveiled plans to open up 600 Dairy Queen restaurants in China by the end of the decade.¬† Then came July 2024, when International Dairy Queen teamed up with FountainVest Partner‚Äôs franchise ownership company CFB Group to open what‚Äôs said then to be the first DQ Blizzard & Burgers restaurant in Shanghai in Asia. So what was the rationale behind the firm‚Äôs aggressive expansion moves? And how far will the company‚Äôs international business bolster sales as global trade tensions and tariffs weigh on consumption in the US?

Chapo Trap House can certainly boast a wildly devoted fan base (and a not insignificant degree of media influence), but their audience is roughly half the size of Kulinski‚Äôs.While Secular Talk might be more likely to be looped in with the progressive networks around Air America and Pacifica alums like Sam Seder than the more resolutely socialist world, Kulinski‚Äôs fiery rhetoric, razor-sharp class instincts, and knack for withering takedowns sets him apart from his peers. Judging by his rhetoric alone, he‚Äôs closer to a Eugene Debs than a Chris Hayes.But unlike Hayes, Amy Goodman, or his friend Cenk Uygur of The Young Turks ‚Äî who began airing Secular Talk on his web network seven years ago ‚Äî the thirty-two-year-old Kulinski is virtually invisible in the mainstream media. Despite his enormous fan base, his show has never once been mentioned in the obligatory trend pieces on ‚Äúthe Millennial Left‚Äù pumped out by the prestige media. Nor has Kulinski‚Äôs name ever popped up at all in the New York Times, Vox, the New Yorker, New York Magazine, or the Washington Post, despite his leading role in cofounding Justice Democrats, the organization widely credited with sweeping Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the rest of ‚Äúthe Squad‚Äù to power.Just last week, his Wikipedia page was deleted. The reason? ‚ÄúThere is very simply no [reliable source] coverage of this person,‚Äù according to one moderator. In new media, he‚Äôs king ‚Äî the Sean Hannity of the Berniecrat left. In old media, he‚Äôs nobody.I suspect there are a few reasons for that. There is nothing ‚Äúcool‚Äù about Kulinski‚Äôs show. (As a friend put it, ‚Äú‚ÄòWelcome to Secular Talk‚Äô sounds like something you‚Äôd hear on Egyptian radio.‚Äù) His no-nonsense social-democratic politics won‚Äôt get him much cred with the Full Communism crowd. He records his show not in Brooklyn or Los Angeles, but in a studio he built himself in his modest Westchester home. His hair is too groomed and his taste in clothes too preppy to qualify as ‚ÄúDirtbag Left.‚Äù Nor has he ever attended an n+1 release party. ‚ÄúNot only have I not attended one,‚Äù he says, ‚ÄúI have no idea what that means.‚ÄùAnd yet he‚Äôs astonishingly plugged-in for a young man in the suburbs. Wondering how Sanders ended up on the Joe Rogan Experience? Kulinski, a frequent guest on Rogan‚Äôs wildly popular show, introduced them. ‚ÄúYou make the most sense to me,‚Äù Rogan told Kulinski on a recent episode. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a normal person.‚ÄùMuch like Sanders himself, Kulinski‚Äôs show has a massive audience that just doesn‚Äôt compute with our media‚Äôs understanding of ‚Äúwhat the kids want‚Äù or even ‚Äúwhat the left-wing kids want.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs probably for the best ‚Äî the very woke and very WASP-ish decorum haunting much of the media world is nowhere to be found in Secular Talk. ‚ÄúCorporate Democrats over-focus on identity as a trick to divert you from the issues that unite us all ‚Äî class issues,‚Äù he said on a recent episode. ‚ÄúThat Raytheon decided they don‚Äôt hate gays or trans people ‚Äî frankly, I don‚Äôt really give a shit what their take on that is...""Read More Here!: https://jacobinmag.com/2020/03/kyle-kulinski-bernie-bros-secular-talk-joe-rogan-youtube #KyleKulinski #SecularTalk¬†",https://open.spotify.com/episode/0vpGj8TFjsTJmAIxNoAXhF,2024-10-01,5OGGuJD0txpWV0QOETTcjU,The Kyle Kulinski Show,Kyle Kulinski,1761323037.1621213

The guys dig into what this technology might mean, how it could change everyday life, and why so many people connect it to the biblical idea of the mark of the beast. They talk through the practical side of tech shifts we‚Äôve all experienced, from paper boarding passes to biometric scans, and ask what it would look like if people could no longer buy, sell, or even travel without adopting the latest invention. At the same time, they keep the focus on Scripture, pointing out the difference between using technology and turning it into an idol. The conversation is both serious and lighthearted, with moments of laughter as they imagine the strange possibilities of nanotech tattoos. But at its heart, the episode reminds listeners that salvation isn‚Äôt about avoiding a device or a system‚Äîit‚Äôs about where your worship and trust are placed.See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eqbCrsEOT9vvS1iLVNmoa,2025-09-15,5HLsz7WFjW8hzJurMDdozi,Granger Smith Podcast,iHeartPodcasts,1761323037.9047155

They were on the threshold of one of those moments when history held its breath... and jumped, as it had done with the development of the car and the airplane. They could either lead the revolution or be swept along by it.Bill had a monomaniacal quality. He would focus on something and really stick with it.

It was like Roosevelt telling Churchill that he could deal with Stalin.Four years in and Microsoft had only 11 employees.Gates sustained Microsoft through tireless salesmanship. For several years he alone made the cold calls and haggled, cajoled, browbeat, and harangued the hardware makers of the emerging personal computer industry, convincing them to buy Microsoft's services and products. He was the best kind of salesman there is: he knew the product, and he believed in it. Moreover, he approached every client with the zealotry of a true believer.When we got up to 30 employees, it was still just me, a secretary, and 28 programmers. I wrote all the checks, answered the mail, took the phone calls.This might be Bill‚Äôs most important decision ever: IBM had talked to Gates about a fixed price for an unlimited number of copies of the software Microsoft licensed to IBM. The longer Gates thought about this proposal the more he became convinced it was bad business. Gates had decided to insist on a royalty arrangement with IBM.You have to be uncompromised in your level of commitment to whatever you are doing, or it can disappear as fast as it appeared.¬†Look around, just about any person or entity achieving at a high level has the same focus.

Bill Gates,"""Bill Gates""",10ADkRIcCl3e3JnyqldcDz,#140 Bill Gates (the Making of the Microsoft Empire),"What I learned from reading Hard Drive: Bill Gates and the Making of the Microsoft Empire by James Wallace and Jim Erickson.¬†----Microsoft had become the first software company to sell more than a billion dollars worth of software in a single year.¬†Gates was the undisputed mastermind of that success, a brilliant technocrat, ruthless salesman, and manipulative businessman.¬†Gates had slammed his fist into his palm and vowed to put several of his major software competitors out of business. By 1991, many of those competitors were in full retreat.¬†I can do anything I put my mind to.¬†Aggressive and stimulated by conflict; prone to change mood quickly; a dominating personality with outstanding powers of leadership.¬†Mary Gates, in describing her son, has said that he has pretty much done what he wanted since the age of eight.¬†Even as a child Gates had an obsessive personality and a compulsive need to be the best.¬†Everything Bill did, he did to the max.¬†Everything he did, he did competitively and not simply to relax. He was a very driven individual.¬†Gates was immediately hooked. He found he had to compete for time on the computer with a handful of others who were similarly drawn to the room as if by a powerful gravitational force. Among them was Paul Allen.¬†Gates devoured everything he could get his hands on concerning computers and how to communicate with them, often teaching himself as he went.¬†Gates and a couple of other boys broke into the PDP-10 security system and obtained access to the company‚Äôs accounting files. They found their personal accounts and substantially reduced the amount of time the computer showed they had used.¬†‚ÄúIt was when we got that free time that we really got into computers,‚Äù Gates said. ‚ÄúThen I became hardcore. It was day and night.‚Äù Gates was 13 years old.¬†Although he was only in the ninth grade, he already seemed obsessed with the computer, ignoring everything else, staying out all night.¬†He consumed biographies to understand how the great figures in history thought.¬†If you had asked anybody at Lakeside, ‚ÄòWho is the real genius among geniuses?‚Äô everyone would have said ‚ÄòBill Gates.‚ÄôHe was obnoxious, he was sure of himself, he was aggressively, intimidatingly smart.¬†He had a hard-nosed, confrontational style. His intensity at times boiled over into raw, unthrottled emotion.¬†To those who knew him best Gates was hardly the social outcast he may have appeared to be from a distance. He had a sense of humor and adventure.¬†He was a risk taker, a guy who liked to have fun and who was fun to be with.¬†He had an immense range of knowledge and interests and could talk at length on any number of subjects.¬†Although Gates may not have known what he was going to do with his life, he seemed confident that whatever he did would make him a lot of money. He made such a prediction about his future on several occasions.¬†He and Paul Allen began to talk about forming their own software company. They shared the same vision that one day the computer would be as commonplace in the home as a television set and that these computers would need software‚Äîtheir software.¬†Bill Gates would later tell a friend he went to Harvard to learn from people smarter than he was and left disappointed.¬†That Gates would fall asleep in class was not surprising. He was living on the edge. It was not unusual for him to go as long as three days without sleep.¬†His habit was to do 36 hours or more at a stretch, collapse for ten hours, then go out, get a pizza, and go back at it. And if that meant he was starting again at three o‚Äôclock in the morning, so be it.¬†Gates and Allen were convinced the computer industry was about to reach critical mass, and when it exploded it would usher in a technological revolution of astounding magnitude. They were on the threshold of one of those moments when history held its breath and jumped, as it had done with the development of the car and the airplane.¬†They could either lead the revolution or be swept along by it.¬†Gates spent many hours sitting in his room ‚Äúbeing a philosophical depressed guy, trying to figure out what I was doing with my life.‚ÄùBill had a monomanical quality. He would really focus on something and stick with it. He had a determination to master whatever it was he was doing. Bill was deciding where he was going to put his energy and to hell with what anyone else thought.¬†Gates eventually gave up any thought of becomming a mathematician. If he couldn‚Äôt be the best in his field, why risk failure?¬†Gates knew Allen was right. It was time. The personal computer miracle was going to happen.The personal computer revolution had begun. Its prophets were two young men not yet old enough to drink, whose software would soon bring executives in suits from around the country to a highway desert town to make million-dollar deals with kids in blue jeans and t-shirts.¬†You‚Äôve got to remember that in those days, the idea that you could own a computer, your own computer, was about as wild as the idea today of owning your own nuclear submarine. It was beyond comprehension.¬†His parents and grandparents had taught him to be financially conservative, and that was the way he intended to run his company. There would be no unnecessary overhead or extravagant spending habits with Microsoft.¬†Bill always had the vision that Microsoft‚Äôs mission was to provide all the software for microcomputers.¬†They became known as the Microkids‚Äîhigh-IQ insomniacs who wanted to join the personal computer crusade, kids with a passion for computers who would drive themselves to the limits of their ability and endurance.¬†Gates‚Äô tireless salesmanship, browbeating, and haggling had resulted in agreements to license BASIC to a number of computer companies.¬†He took one look at the long-haired, scraggly, 21-year-old and decided the legal battle against Microsoft was going to be easy. Roberts had warned Pertec that it would have its hands full with Gates, but no one listened to him. ‚ÄúPertec kept telling me I was being unreasonable and they could deal with this guy,‚Äù Roberts said. ‚ÄúIt was a little like Roosevelt telling Churchill that he could deal with Stalin.‚Äù¬†What sustained the company was not Gates‚Äô ability to write programs. Gates sustained Microsoft through tireless salesmanship.¬†For several years, he alone made the cold calls and haggled, cajoled, browbeat, and harangued the hardware makers, convincing them to buy Microsoft‚Äôs services and products.¬†When we got up to 30 employees, it was still just me, a secretary, and 28 programmers. I wrote all the checks, answered the mail, and took the phone calls.¬†I‚Äôll tell you or anybody else, that by the time you were with Bill for fifteen minutes, you no longer thought about how old he was or what he looked like. He had the most brilliant mind that I had ever dealt with.¬†Microsoft did not need venture capital; Gates was essentially hiring the firm‚Äôs expertise.¬†Gates wanted to eliminate his opponents from the playing field. Bill learned early on that killing the competition is the name of the game. There just aren‚Äôt as many people later to take you on. In game theory, you improve the probability you are going to win if you have fewer competitors.¬†If you talk to Bill about any software company there‚Äôs a very high probability that he will be able to tell you who the CEO is, what their revenues were last year, what they are currently working on, what the problems are with their products. He‚Äôs very knowledgeable and prides himself on knowing what‚Äôs going on in the industry.¬†Hanson suggested a different product naming strategy. It was important for a product to be identified by its brand name. Microsoft had to get its name associated with its products.The brand is the hero. People start to associate certain images with the brand, and that becomes more important than any single product. What the consumer goods companies realized years ago was that products come and go. But if you can create a halo around a brand name, when you introduce new products under that brand halo it becomes much easier to create momentum.¬†With few exceptions, they‚Äôve never shipped a good product in its first version. But they never give up and eventually get it right. It was all part of Gates‚Äô master plan. As General George S. Patton liked to say, a good plan, violently executed now, is better than a perfect plan next week.¬†He was a very clear thinker. But he would get emotional. He would browbeat people. Just imposing your intellectual prowess on somebody doesn‚Äôt win the battle, and he didn‚Äôt know that. He was very rich and very immature. He had never matured emotionally.¬†For the year that ended June 30, 1985, Microsoft had revenues of $140 million. Its profits had totaled $31.2 million.¬†All I‚Äôm thinking and dreaming about is selling software, not stock.¬†The combination of ambition and wanting to win every single day is what Gates referred to as ‚Äúbeing hardcore.‚Äù ----Founders Notes gives you the ability to tap into the collective knowledge of history's greatest entrepreneurs on demand.

Use it to supplement the decisions you make in your work. ¬†Get access to Founders Notes here.¬†----A small team of A+ players can run circles around a giant team of B and C players. ‚ÄîSteve Jobs¬†There are no shortcuts around quality, and quality starts with people. ‚ÄîSteve Jobs¬†Usually people never think that much about what they're doing or why they do it. They just do it because that's the way it has been done and it works. That type of thinking doesn't work if you're growing fast and if you're up against some larger companies. You really have to outthink them and you have to be able to make those paradigm shifts in your points of view. ‚ÄîSteve Jobs¬†‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîSteve Jobs answer to What advice would you give someone interested in starting their own company?A lot of people ask me, ""I want to start a company. What should I do?"" My first question is always, ""What is your passion? What is it you want to do in your company?"" Most of them say, ""I don't know.""My advice is go get a job as a busboy until you figure it out. You've got to be passionate about something. You shouldn't start a company because you want to start a company. Almost every company I know of got started because nobody else believed in the idea and the last resort was to start the company. That's how Apple got started. That's how Pixar got started. It's how Intel got started. You need to have passion about your idea and you need to feel so strongly about it that you're willing to risk a lot.Starting a company is so hard that if you're not passionate about it, you will give up. If you're simply doing it because you want to have a small company, forget it.It's so much work and at times is so mentally draining. The hardest thing I've ever done is to start a company. It's the funnest thing, but it's the hardest thing, and if you're not passionate about your goal or your reason for doing it, you will give up. You will not see it through. So, you must have a very strong sense of what you want.You have to need to run such a business and know you can do it better than anyone else.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîThere are no safe harbors. The only safe harbor is competency. Competency at doing something. ‚ÄîT.J. Rodgers founder of Cypress SemiconductorThe first time someone says, ‚ÄúThe product you've made has changed my life,"" is the biggest sense of satisfaction you get. It motivates me more than anything else, by far. ‚ÄîCharles Geschke, founder of AdobeBeing detached from the customer is the ultimate death. ‚ÄîMichael Dell¬†The faster you experiment and get rid of things that don't work and keep doing things that do work, the faster you get to the winning business model. ‚ÄîMichael DellThe important things of tomorrow are probably going to be things that are overlooked today. ‚ÄîAndy Grove¬†The best assumption to have is that any commonly held belief is wrong. ‚ÄîKen Olsen¬† ----Founders Notes gives you the ability to tap into the collective knowledge of history's greatest entrepreneurs on demand.

Since stepping away from the company, Gates has devoted himself to his foundation, which is one of the largest nonprofits working on public health around the globe. That has made him the target of conspiracy theories by anti-vaxxers, including Robert F.

Gates views the rise of conspiracy thinking as symptomatic of larger trends in American society exacerbated by technology. ‚ÄúThe fact that outrage is rewarded because it‚Äôs more engaging, that‚Äôs kind of a human weakness,‚Äù he tells David Remnick. ‚ÄúAnd the fact that I thought everybody would be doing deep analysis of facts and seeking out the actual studies on vaccine safety‚Äîboy, was that na√Øve.

Bill Gates,"""Bill Gates""",43H5XGWeGfNwDx9w4aKjCL,Is Bill Gates' Apeel Really Safe?,"In this podcast, we‚Äôre going to talk about Bill Gates‚Äô new product, Apeel, which is used to make fresh produce last longer. Of the ingredients in Apeel, 99.34 percent are listed as ‚Äúother ingredients,‚Äù which is a red flag because of the lack of transparency.  We know that Apeel contains monoglycerides and diglycerides‚Äîemulsifiers, which help mix things together. Apeel also contains solvents and heavy metals, including palladium, cadmium, lead, mercury, and arsenic! Manufacturers claim these metals are safe in small amounts, but there is no data about chronic consumption over time. Apeel also contains polyethylene glycol, a compound found in antifreeze.   Apeel could be a partially hydrogenated product. The FDA has banned trans fats, but loopholes still allow manufacturers to use them in their products.   If a product has less than .5 grams of trans fats, the FDA allows them to round it down to zero and not report the trans fats in the product. If a product is classified as an emulsifier, not a lipid or fat, it is exempt from the FDA‚Äôs ban on trans fats.  There is some controversy surrounding the function of the Apeel coating on produce. Is it a coating to keep food fresh or a fungicide? The EPA and the OMRI describe Apeel as a fungicide used after harvest, but Apeel is advertised as a protective coating.   There‚Äôs no way to remove the Apeel coating from your fresh produce, so it could potentially lock pesticides or pathogens inside. Think twice about buying fruits and vegetables that have this coating on them.

In 2000, he and his wife, Melinda, launched the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation which has given to date over $34 billion to projects aimed at reducing health inequality around the world.Born into a professional family - his father was a lawyer, his mother a former teacher who later became involved with volunteer work - he was introduced to the idea of 'giving back' at an early age. An avid reader as a child, he attended Harvard where in his sophomore year he and Paul Allen developed software for the first micro-computers. The company would go on to achieve huge success with its Windows operating system. By 1987, Gates had become the world's youngest self-made billionaire, then worth $1.25 billion. Consistently listed as the Richest Man in the World, he stepped down as CEO of the company in 2000 although he remained as Chairman until 2014. These days his primary focus is his philanthropy. In 2010, Gates and his friend Warren Buffett announced the Giving Pledge which aims to inspire the wealthy people of the world to give away the majority of their net worth to worthy causes.Producer: Cathy Drysdale.",https://open.spotify.com/episode/0W6dd2UoKTcKsyawVhOHPM,2016-02-04,2T28kNzyAOX64ahUz5oyXa,Desert Island Discs,BBC Radio 4,1761323041.0661044

Bill Gates and Energy (2/2) ‚Äì the Investments / Breakthrough Energy Ventures,"In episode 143, Gerard, Laurent and Michael have discussed the philosophy of Bill Gates when it comes to the Energy Transition, and the root causes of his flawed thesis. Let see now if this transpires in his main investment vehicle, Breakthrough Energy Ventures (BEV).Michael Barnard is quite blunt: ‚ÄúTo be clear, Gates is still highly resistant to the reality that we have almost all of the solutions we require, and that Breakthrough Energy Ventures is mostly invested in distractions.‚Äù As we are about to celebrate the 10th anniversary of BEV, we dive into its successes and failures. And it is a complex picture. BEV has invested in more than 100 companies which is a feat in itself. ¬†For a 3.5bnUSD portfolio, that‚Äôs an average of 40mUSD/ticket.When you dig into the portfolio, you will get the Good, with promising ventures (such as Antora, Rondo, Boston Metals, Brimstone, TS Conductor, Fervo, Natel, Pachama, Kobold), the bad with ginormous boondoggles (nuclear, carbon, Hydrogen planes, LDES‚Ä¶), and the Ugly, when BEV (but they are not alone) manage to offload failed ventures via SPACs (Heliogen, QuantumScape, ESS)¬† or Public Money (Carbon Engineering). ¬†So, Breakthrough or Break down? Glass half full or half empty? ¬†A lot of Silicon Valley billionaires have emulated BEV, with absurd amount of money chasing impossible or totally uneconomic ventures. To name a few, Sam Altman, Khosla Ventures, Patrick Collinson (CEO Stripe) Bezos, Benioff. So, Bill is definitely not alone.¬†And BEV, with a string of smart choices, is probably the least bad, or best of them all. ¬†Michael Barnard unleashed in Cleantechnica https://cleantechnica.com/2024/07/04/breakthrough-energy-ventures-has-bad-investment-theses-therefore-bad-investments/",https://open.spotify.com/episode/18S7NgPMmA5bv25jPrha7p,2024-08-04,4FDIRo16s1C9Fpc9v1HyGi,Redefining Energy,Laurent Segalen and Gerard Reid,1761323041.0922246

Why are different cities seeing such different outcomes? Do rich and poor countries need different responses? What are the true chances of a vaccine in 18 months?

In 2000, he and his wife, Melinda, launched the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation which has given to date over $34 billion to projects aimed at reducing health inequality around the world.Born into a professional family - his father was a lawyer, his mother a former teacher who later became involved with volunteer work - he was introduced to the idea of 'giving back' at an early age. An avid reader as a child, he attended Harvard where in his sophomore year he and Paul Allen developed software for the first micro-computers.

Taking a bird‚Äôs-eye view of society‚Äôs challenges, it‚Äôs easy to give in to pessimism. But as one of the most influential people in the world, Bill Gates has a unique perspective on how far humanity has come and what our potential‚Äîand timelines‚Äîfor meaningful change really look like. He gets granular on everything from cows (5% of global emissions) to disease reduction and eradication (Guinea worm disease). At each turn, he has data at his fingertips to ground his beliefs.

Bill Gates,"""Bill Gates""",4GOK2P1aMxo6OCOHcbGhlE,"Mega Edition:  Bill Gates, The Endless Apologies And The CNN Interview (9/25/25)","Bill Gates‚Äôs attempts at damage control over his ties to Jeffrey Epstein have always sounded less like sincere apologies and more like carefully worded PR spin. He repeatedly leaned on the same tired line that he ‚Äúmade a mistake‚Äù by meeting Epstein, as if multiple visits, a cozy dinner at Epstein‚Äôs Manhattan townhouse, and repeated interactions could somehow be reduced to a one-off lapse in judgment. His apologies are weasel-like because they dodge the central issue: Gates didn‚Äôt just bump into Epstein‚Äîhe engaged with him knowingly, long after Epstein was a convicted sex offender. Instead of admitting that he chose power networking over morality, he frames it as a regrettable oversight, a minor slip in judgment, as though the public should simply nod along and accept that excuse.Even worse, Gates couches his apologies in a tone of self-pity, acting as though he‚Äôs the real victim because people keep asking him about it. Rather than grappling with the disgust of survivors who know exactly what Epstein was, Gates seems more concerned about how the association tarnishes his image and legacy. He wants the world to believe that his proximity to a predator was an innocent blunder, when in reality it was deliberate and calculated‚ÄîEpstein had money, connections, and a reputation Gates clearly found useful. The result is an apology that reeks of arrogance and evasion, a weasel-like maneuver to deflect blame while never fully owning the gravity of choosing to keep company with a man everyone knew was radioactive.to¬† contact me:bobbycapucci@protonmail.com",https://open.spotify.com/episode/4GOK2P1aMxo6OCOHcbGhlE,2025-09-26,2ZECi9Vlf5XYWDmC4XRYPe,The Diddy Diaries,Bobby Capucci,1761323044.814387

Bill Gates,"""Bill Gates""",0xYX3604vaKkw1IkiEnoyO,Why Bill Gates is worried,"‚ÄúTo put it bluntly,‚Äù wrote Bill and Melinda Gates in their foundation‚Äôs annual Goalkeepers Report, ‚Äúdecades of stunning progress in the fight against poverty and disease may be on the verge of stalling. This is because the poorest parts of the world are growing faster than everywhere else; more babies are being born in the places where it‚Äôs hardest to lead a healthy and productive life.‚Äù There is no topic in the philanthropic world more fraught than population growth. The history of efforts to analyze and address it is filled with bad predictions and cruel solutions. The Gateses, though, are trying to take a different approach to the issue. Rather than seeing a population problem in the demographic projections, they‚Äôre framing it as a poverty problem ‚Äî and, for that matter, an opportunity. In this conversation, I talk with Bill Gates about the report and about much more: the geographic and political forces that have held African development back, whether economic growth brings political freedom, the risks posed by artificial intelligence, and how we should weigh future human lives and current animal suffering. This conversation also marks the launch of a new Vox podcast and section, Future Perfect, which focuses on evidence-based ways to make the world a better place. You can find the section at Vox.com, and you can find the podcast, which is hosted by my colleague and friend Dylan Matthews, wherever you get your podcasts. Enjoy!

Whitney Webb is a writer and researcher mostly covering intelligence, tech, surveillance and civil liberties. One Nation Under Blackmail¬†is a damning indictment of the consequences resulting from the nearly century old relationship between both US and Israeli intelligence and the organized criminal network known as the National Crime Syndicate. This book specifically explores how that nexus between intelligence and organized crime directly developed the sexual blackmail tactics and networks that would later enable the sexual blackmail operation and other crimes of deceased pedophile and sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. Other books on Jeffrey Epstein focus on the depraved nature of his crimes, his wealth, and his most famous/politically-connected friends and acquaintances. This book, in contrast, reveals the extent to which Epstein‚Äôs activities were state-sponsored through an exploration of his intelligence connections.",https://open.spotify.com/episode/4GKPM01vw3WZ0jaY0EN8zZ,2021-05-22,30DqNXrHLKzz4xzmoty6xf,RFK Jr Podcast,Robert Kennedy Jr,1761323046.8609736

This principle is completely independent of money, fame, and significance; which is clearly what is being shown in society today.¬† In this episode Aaron will dive into just what this principle is so that you can raise your level of connection and love in your own relationship. On top of that, you will know that love and connection is not something that just happens or doesn‚Äôt happen based on circumstances.

He draws attention to hard to decarbonize sectors like Agriculture, Cement and Steel and introduces the concept of the ""Green Premium"" as a metric to identify decarbonization innovation priorities.¬† Gates pours cold water on the common use of Moore's law as a model for rosey energy sector modelling. He points to the importance of marrying mitigation to adaptation in order for those most vulnerable to the effects of climate change to have the best chances to endure it.¬† Leigh and I talk agriculture, energy, innovation and most importantly the politics including taxation that can enable the state investment in R&D and deployment that Gates calls for and yet has resisted many times as a member of the billionaire class.¬† Leigh Phillips is a science writer and political journalist whose work has appeared in Nature, Science, the Guardian, and Jacobin.

Bill Gates' book 'How to Avoid a Climate Disaster' explores the critical technological challenges and solutions needed to address global climate change. Gates argues that transitioning away from fossil fuels requires a comprehensive, global approach that considers renewable energy sources, production methods, and technological innovations. He emphasizes the importance of understanding the complexity of greenhouse gas emissions across various sectors like transportation, food production, manufacturing, and energy consumption.  The book highlights several key strategies for mitigating climate change, including developing global renewable energy solutions, revolutionizing production methods like cement manufacturing, embracing nuclear fission technology, and transforming food production. Gates proposes that technological innovations, such as lab-grown meat and electric vehicles, can play a crucial role in reducing emissions. He also stresses the importance of government policies and individual consumer choices in driving meaningful environmental change.  Gates provides practical guidance for individuals and policymakers, offering five critical questions to ask when discussing climate change and outlining potential solutions across different sectors. He acknowledges that achieving net-zero emissions is extremely challenging and will require significant technological advancements, political will, and global cooperation. Despite the complexity, Gates maintains an optimistic perspective, believing that innovative technologies and collective action can help humanity avoid a potential climate disaster.    KEY TOPICS AND FIGURES:  Climate Change, Renewable Energy, Technology, Emissions, Sustainability, Innovation, Environment, Policy, Energy, Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, TerraPower, How to Avoid a Climate Disaster, StoryShots, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation    KEY TAKEAWAYS:   Climate change is a complex global challenge that requires comprehensive technological innovation across multiple sectors, including energy, transportation, food production, and manufacturing    Renewable energy solutions must be globally implemented, recognizing that different regions have varying economic constraints and energy needs    Nuclear fission could be a critical technology in achieving net-zero emissions, with advanced fail-safe reactor designs offering potential solutions    Individual consumer choices matter, but systemic changes in government policy and corporate practices are essential to meaningful climate action    Transitioning away from fossil fuels is challenging because current green technologies often have higher costs (green premiums) compared to traditional energy sources    Food production, particularly animal agriculture, contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and requires substantial technological transformation    KEY QUOTES:   ""Gates believes this challenge is greater than the innovation required for men to land on the moon and get a computer in every person's house. This could be humanity's greatest ever challenge."" - StoryShots Narrator    ""Gates argues that nuclear fission is potentially the best global solution to reaching net zero. Nuclear energy has a negative reputation due to high publicity disasters, but Gates doesn't believe we should give up on it so easily."" - StoryShots Narrator   Learn more about your ad choices.

Bill Gates,"""Bill Gates""",5LFIeHcJTGqmMK0sBLPsEL,"Bill Gates Funded Orgs Now Recognize Fertility Collapse, Excited to Fight Over African Immigrants","In this thought-provoking episode, Malcolm and Simone Collins discuss a controversial Lancet study funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that predicts a dramatic decline in global fertility rates by 2100. The couple delves into the study's alarming implications, including the potential for wealthy nations to exploit impoverished countries as ""human farms"" to sustain their economies through immigration. Malcolm and Simone also examine the study's celebration of population decline as a ""success story"" and its call for explicitly left-wing solutions to rebuild society. Throughout the conversation, they critique the study's assumptions, highlight the ethical concerns surrounding coercive immigration policies, and warn of the long-term consequences of treating human beings as mere economic resources. Simone Collins: [00:00:00] While the scenario may sound alarming, the paper describes the collapse in global birth rates as a, quote unquote, success story.Fewer humans means less carbon emissions, the paper, observed. urged readers to prepare for a rapidly shrinking global population where most newborns worldwide are in sub Saharan Africa, where wealthy countries compete fiercely for immigrants to prop up their economies.This is a vision for the year 2100 provided by Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationWould you like to know more?Simone Collins: Okay. What? I, I was just clicking through to the research square article. Withdrawn the association between adult penile length and IQ evidences from 139Malcolm Collins: countries. Why is that? Why would they withdraw it forSimone Collins: that reason? 22 February 2024, Research Square has withdrawn this preprint due to the problematic nature of the topic concerning race and intelligence.We acknowledge the [00:01:00] sensitivities involved and the potential for misrepresentation or harm. This decision reflects our commitment to disseminate, disseminate, withdraw on research that meets our rigorous standards for integrity and respect for all individuals. Please refer toMalcolm Collins: our, so people who know what this article was on, it, it correlated IQ with penis links.Yeah. And, and it did obviously break its cohorts by ethnic group. And unfortunately this ended up showing IQ differences in ethnic groups, which led to the paper being theSimone Collins: results are still posted. I'll, I'll I'll, I'll read the results. statistically significant negative correlation was found between flaccid penile length and IQ, indicating higher IQs in individuals with shorter penile lengths and notable ethnic differences were observed.Oh no. And so it's so funny though, because like, you'd think that this would be protracted. Because it's about. But I was just [00:02:00] reflecting on the fact that you somehow, despite, you know, all this, get to buck the trend and you've got both the big package and the big brain, I hope you appreciate what you haveMalcolm Collins: to crude for this podcast.Simone. I didn't putSimone Collins: disseminated in this. I didn't putMalcolm Collins: talk about a really fascinating article today that I was going over because progressives are now beginning to admit that we've got a problem. We're not that we've got a problem, but that global fertility is crashing Much more rapidly and much faster than they thought before they are.It's exciting. It was an article where I was like, okay, what I'm going to do is I am going to read segments from this article. Like we usually do when we're going over articles, just like the important points. But I just went through it. I was like every line in this is worth reacting to because it is so fascinating.So what we're going to be going through and talking through is not the [00:03:00] original article. But the Breitbart article that takes out the important points, because this gives us an opportunity to one, already have all the important points condensed, but both react to the extreme leftist position on this and the extreme rightist position on this.Simone Collins: Lancet article, right? That's a very respected journal. That was published sort of per the prerogative of Bill Gates.Malcolm Collins: Well, we'll just go through. So, the, the article that we'll be reading from is titled quote, dramatic decline in global fertility in quote by 2100 developed nations will fiercely compete for migrants.Bill Gates funded Lancet article predicts,Simone Collins: quote, open immigration will be vital to maintain population size and economic growth, unquote.A Bill Gates funded study published in the Lancet this week claimed, predicting a grim future where people having children in developed countries becomes rare. So woohoo! They're validating us, right? I mean, this isMalcolm Collins: Yeah. Yeah. Even progressives now admit that we were [00:04:00] right about all of this and we were crazy.Simone Collins: We fight for open immigration of, of competent. People who want to come in, I will continue the future is difficult to predict the study conceded, but nevertheless urged readers to prepare for a rapidly shrinking global population where most newborns worldwide are in sub Saharan Africa, where wealthy countries compete fiercely for immigrants to prop up their economies.This is a vision for the year 2100 provided by a Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funded study from the University of Washington Seattle's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, IHME, published by the In the increasingly woke Lancet Journal that counsels birth control for Africa and open borders for Europe to survive the coming decades.You can tell that this is a Breitbart article.Malcolm Collins: Hold on, you gotta read the tweet thing here.Simone Collins: Okay, so here's the tweet that they released. That is to say that the [00:05:00] Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation released. Explosion emoji, traumatic declines in global fertility forecasted to transform global population patterns.Fertility levels significantly below replacement levels by 2100 only with only six countries able to continue maintaining population size over time. Hashtag GBD 2021. Then they link to their Lancet article. It isMalcolm Collins: wild. Hold on. And in the Lancet article is titled in 2100, half of the children born on the planet will be in Sub Saharan Africa.But they're admittingSimone Collins: it!Malcolm Collins: They're, they're, they're, it's totally No, they're, they're estoling this. They're like, all of the world will be fighting over these people born in Sub Saharan Africa. And it's like, no! Like, okay, first of all, they're, we have said this in op eds that we wrote, that like, the progressive plan around this is racist.They basically want to treat Africa like a human farm, because they will only be fighting over people in these countries. If these countries are unable [00:06:00] to achieve the economies that lead to below fertility replacement rate, even in Africa, when a country goes above 5, 000 USD per year in their, their average GDP or average, you know, yearly income per family, sorry, not GDP.They fall below replacement rate, so they have to keep these countries poor and then they want to use them like human farms and bid over the people who are being shipped from them to support their economies.Simone Collins: They're banking on poverty, they're banking on continued impoverishment for very deserving nations that is to say very deserving of development nations.Yeah, butMalcolm Collins: also I want to be realistic. Like, what do we think? Like we often like laugh at the progressives for saying, ha ha ha, you know, they're banking on poverty, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But like, let's be realistic. Our country is actually going to be fighting over immigrants from sub Saharan Africa.Not, but a hundred years from now, not, not 50 years from now, because people misunderstand throw out. [00:07:00] Any of the, the, the accusations of like different IQs among different ethnic groups, right? Like ignore that. Okay. If you have a population, okay. Like Haiti is a great example of this happening and intergenerationally, you remove 85 percent of the people from that country who graduate with college degrees every single generation.And you do that for like five years. Four or five generations, even throw out the genetics part. Culturally, you are going to have a population in that country that is incredibly hostile to education because you have intergenerationally, so you don't even need genetics to play a role here. You are creating pools of people that are going to be, and if you have a country where every single time somebody in that country makes a lot of money, they leave.Which is also what happened in Haiti. So Haiti is a great example of what's going to end up happening to these places. So every single person who makes over a certain amount of money [00:08:00] and wants security for their family leaves. Every, or not every single person, but let's say 85 percent of the people who make a lot of money want security for their families leave.And 85 percent of the people who get college degrees leave. Intergenerationally, culturally speaking, that country is going to produce less people like that. And this is going to lead to environments where even though they're producing a lot of. People, these people do not fit the economic hole that is left by the lack of people in the developed world.They are not useful economic input. Well, because asSimone Collins: we've said many times before, what nations really need, especially, so, okay, in terms of butt wipers, fine, maybe, maybe but what nations Also really need aside from labor, which I think many people miss in these discussions about demographic collapse is taxpayers because someone has to hold up the pensions.Someone has to pay taxes to maintain schools and roads to make sure city infrastructure doesn't crumble, to make sure governments still are stable. And so if you don't bring in people who are [00:09:00] economic producers, who are smart enough to move an economy forward, to innovate, you're in a pretty bad position.And other people in our general sphere have recently been Tweeting about how Oh, actually more births who was on our podcast recently recently tweeted a really interesting graph arguing how demographic collapse hurts the most innovative countries right now. The most apparently, you know, like the, the most.Quickly innovating, amazing, technologically advanced cultures and nations are going kaput. If, if you don't find a way to make more of those people somehow, it's a, it's bad.Malcolm Collins: People really, like, we are, like, fundamentally, it doesn't, it doesn't, Exactly matter that the number of humans is collapsing. Okay.We're not fighting for endless humans. And we always talk about this. We're like economically productive cultural groups, like in here, keep going, we're not even talking about genetics, just cultures, right? Economically productive cultures. And this is true within countries and between countries. So if I'm [00:10:00] going to sub Saharan Africa, the more economically productive an individual is, the more likely they are to either leave and then have their fertility crash or have lower fertility within their own countries.And so people here are economically productive and they don't understand what I mean by this. So, to word this another way, the problem is that we don't have tax payers anymore. It's not that we don't have humans anymore, it's that we don't have tax payers anymore. And tax payers are what you need for all of these progressive solutions you have to things like poverty.Poverty and homelessness and people starving and singleSimone Collins: mothers. Yeah, these aren't immigrants that countries are scrambling to, to bring in just so they can be on social services and not work. And I think that's also another big misconception is there's this weird dichotomy in progressive talk between, you know, you know, we will take your tired masses, right?We will take care of them. We'll help them get back on their feet. Whereas really what they're saying, they need from immigration. When they talk about immigration in the [00:11:00] context of demographic collapse as a solution is, oh, no, no, we're going to brain drain all of your productive workers, leaving you with nothing in your own home nation.And we're totally not going to let in anyone who doesn't contribute to our tax base.Malcolm Collins: Yeah, this is a really twisted thing. So suppose progressives implement this perfectly. So at least for our lifetimes, it'll probably work out. Okay. If you just take everyone from sub Saharan Africa who is economically productive or educated and we just do that.Like. Don't, ignore that this isn't a long term solution, right? Like, ignore the cultural effects this is going to have on everyone involved in this triangle trade the progressives are trying to set up. But just consider the effects that this will have within our lifetime. When I ask a progressive, and I point to, you know, a homeless person, right?And I go, do they deserve some of the income from like, the economically wealthy of our country to, to, to not live in circumstances like this? And they'll say, and I'm like, what about their [00:12:00] kids? Do they deserve that we put them into schools and give them a chance in the progressive state? Of course they do.And I'm like, then why are you stealing the people who would be paying that money if that person lived in Africa? Is it because African homeless people don't matter to you? Is it because you don't give a s**t about black homeless people? Okay? Is it because you don't care about Latin American homeless people?You only care about homeless people if they happen to be born in the United States? The people that we are robbing these countries of are the people who pay into their tax base and allow them to support their own struggling classes. This is absolutely wrong. Catastrophic. And it creates all sorts of horrible disincentives for these countries.Because now if these countries had systems where they were paying for people to get college degrees, for example, and a huge portion of people getting college degrees are leaving the country. Well, now they have an [00:13:00] incentive. To not pay for college degrees anymore because they're losing all that investment to the U S which is basically robbing them of it.This system is horrible, but it also reminds me of a joke I told you earlier today. Whereas you know, people know we're, we're generally you know, we're not super antagonistic to immigration as long as it's of economically productive individuals. However, you know, we have to put this in the context of history and it's like, I feel a bit like I'm hearing from people.Well, the sea people are mostly productive tradesmen and when they come to our country do you not think a sea person can be a potter just as well as an Egyptian sea? Sea people can be potters too. Okay. They're not leaving their countries cause they want to, it's due to climate change, most historians do believe is that the sea people are moving due to a climate change event.And, and, okay. And, if anything, we as Egyptians are, we have the most important gods in our country, so we [00:14:00] likely weren't worshipping them correctly, which led to this climate change. So, how dare you keep the sea people out of our country, where they don't want to displace us, okay? They don't want to cause any sort of turmoil in our civilizational system.They'll come, and they'll take the jobs that Egyptians and Hittites don't want. Pfft. Yeah. And frankly, see people as a term, I find a little bit dehumanizing. Okay. I mean, I can't remember what they're actually called because we didn't record that, but I just find your use of the term see people.Why can't we just call them extra people? I either they're, they're extremely human. In many ways, they're more human than us because they've undergone so much. There you go. I mean, okay, sorry, I had to do my Sea People rant, but continue to move on.Simone Collins: All right, I will continue to read. [00:15:00] While the scenario may sound alarming, the paper and a hefty press release accompanying it describes the collapse in global birth rates as a, quote unquote, success story.Fewer humans means less carbon emissions, the paper, which also received funding from the British, Norwegian, and New Zealand governments, observed. Here's a quote from the paper itself in The Lancet. Although sustained below replacement fertility will pose serious potential challenges for much of the world over the course of the century, it also presents opportunities for environmental progress.Alongside strong pro environmental regulations, a smaller global population in the future would alleviate some strain on global food systems, fragile environments, and other finite resources, and also reduce global warming. carbon emissions. So they're happy about it. Oh yeah,Malcolm Collins: keep reading, keep reading.Simone Collins: According to the paper's co author, the facts of life will require explicitly left wing solutions, and society will have to be rebuilt to suit. Land Research [00:16:00] Scientist from IHME, Dr. Natalia L. Butchering her name, I'm not even trying, said, quote, The implications are immense. The future trends in fertility rates and live births will completely reconfigure the global economy and the international balance of power and will necessitate reorganizing societies, unquote.Malcolm Collins: That is horrifying. So they now admit that this is happening and they're like, Hmm, now our global cabal can have even more power than theySimone Collins: previously had. That they don't somehow think that at least among their little network of nations, including those that funded this Lancet paper, that they aren't already pretty left leaning.I mean, I guess they're not. Universally left leaning. And there have been right No, no, no, no.Malcolm Collins: Sacklashes. Is to extend the control of the organizations that they already own, like the UN, the world health organization, and then other billionaire controlled organizations, and then use those organizations to enhance further [00:17:00] control over this new triangle trade of human, of humans.Then they're like, oh yes, we're going to start using African as a human farm and And we are going to. use this Africa human farm and distribute its resources to our will. And we will have to exercise even more control over the governments that we do control to allow, you know, less dissent, less thought, less, you know, this is a fantasy in which as the number of humans declines, they have even more power.The problem is, is within their own countries, the groups that are still breeding, even the intelligent, economically productive groups like you and me or Elon, are extremely hostile to their interests. The people who are doing these studies, the people who are writing these Lancet reports, I bet they don't have kids, not above replacement rate at least.And, and that's the key to all of this, is they think that we will continue to go along with this. And they think that Even Africans, Africans are going to be okay with their countries kept in [00:18:00] intentional poverty so that they can be farmed by Europeans for humans. The, the, the, No one is okay with this solution, except for this small group of ivory tower elites who literally have never spoken to an African immigrant.Because the funny thing is that a lot of the pro needless movement is actually this first wave of African immigrants that's like super competent. And a lot of conservatives are not aware of like, How smart a lot of the African immigrants to our country are in the first wave of African immigrants, or the first few waves of African immigrants was this immigration cycle.They are incredibly competent, industrious, entrepreneurial people. And they are not excited about shipping everyone else from their country over here. They left for a reason. Okay, they're like, yeah, now I'm in the land of the free. Let's Leave behind what I left behind and let's make sure that this, this country doesn't destroy itself so that my kids can, and, and let's keep the progressives from converting my kids because when the progressives bring them over here, they're like, okay, well, [00:19:00] now we need to work on your homophobia.And the Africans are like, like, f**k if you are okay, buddy, I came over here for the, the, the economic advantage and to be around other Christians or believers, if they're Muslims, you know, not to be around people like you and even us as people who are pro the gay community, even though I'm pro the gay community, I don't think that we have a right to erase the cultural traditions that most Africans have.i. e. not African, American Africans, but Africans who are immigrating from Africa, around how they relate to gender and relationships. It is their right to keep their traditions and we don't get to impose our theological, cosmological, our moral systems on them as if ours are innately superior to theirs.This, anyway, continue.Simone Collins: Okay, I'm going to skip the tweet that they posted because it's just promoting their own. [00:20:00] So this is a continuation of a quote from that woman. Quote, global recognition of the challenges around migration and global aid networks are going to be all the more critical when there is a fierce competition for migrants to sustain economic growth.And as Sub Saharan Africa's baby boom continues apace, she added. The press release on the study predicted that by 2100 quote, half the children born on the planet will be from sub Saharan Africa, primarily in Western and Eastern sub Saharan Africa. So I mean, yeah, they're, they're not wrong about that.It's just their plans on what to do with it. Pretty messed up. Again, your, your healing farm thing.¬†Quote, in low fertility, hi, I'm in, sorry again, I was just thrown by what I'm reading because it's so crazy.Quote, in low fertility, high income economies, policies that support parents and open immigration will be vital to maintain population size and economic growth. It continued in these locations. Populations will shrink unless low fertility can be offset by ethical and [00:21:00] effective immigration. Unquote far from Western nations arguing over how to actually, beforeMalcolm Collins: you go further, I want to note something.Cause this is the very first time we've seen progressive note, this ethical immigration, they're beginning to realize that coercive immigration is something that their policies are going to begin to coerce.And, and, and, and, and encourage and reward. And I wonder what they consider ethical. It's ethical that we take a slice of the entire population of a country is ethical, that we don't just take their best and the brightest, because at the end of the day, people might notice us from our videos, I care about what's happening on the global stage, but I'm still an American Patriot first and foremost, and that's why I'm okay with immigration of the best and brightest because I like what's good for America and I like creating America as a home to the globe's, you know, most adventurous, most ambitious and best and brightest.But I, unlike them, recognize that this [00:22:00] is this comes at a severe cost to the people that were, the countries that we're taking these people from. And that when we bring these people over here, we need to find a way to not erase their cultural background so that they can stay high fertility.Simone Collins: Yeah.Seriously. All right. Far from Western nations arguing over how to best manage migration, the paper prognosticates a future where states fight each other to get their hands on as many migrants as possible. And according to the I H M E's modeling, the only six nations on the earth that will have above replacement fertility rate by 2100 will be Samoa, Somalia, Tonga, Niger, Chad,Simone Collins: Tajikistan. Any hope of countering these issues by encouraging growth and fertility rates in developed countries, for instance,is close to pointless, the paper assured. Discussing the total fertility rate, TFR, which in general means 2. 1 children per woman in a society to achieve cell sustainment, [00:23:00] the IHME professes to have determined, quote, that even under optimistic assumptions, unquote, the impact of prenatal policies will be low.They're not wrong. Abortion is inevitable too, the paper noted, so don't try interfering with that either. There is no silver bullet, unquote,Malcolm Collins: caution. I love this. I love this so much that they have come to all the conclusions we have. It's like, well, the pronatal policies that they would like to implement, i.e. cash handouts. That's what they mean. Pronatal policies don't work. They don't mean protecting diverse. conservative groups that already exist within their countries, i. e. the various different conservative religious traditions that exist within the United States, within Canada, within the UK, because of course, they have a right to those cultures, children.They just need to ship in more for their, Unsustainable human farming practice. What is this other than that, right? That's how their culture survived is by taking children from nearby demographically healthy [00:24:00] cultural groups or shipping them in. And that's what they're saying here. And I love how they're also like, Oh, anything that goes against, but I would know that generally abortion restrictions within a country.We did a piece on this. Like if you look at graphs of Europe by how, strict they are on abortion policies. There is a pretty strict overlap between that and how low their fertility rate is. So just at a functional level, it doesn't really work. But it is you know, I, I hate agreeing with these people on anything, but they're right about that.Simone Collins: No, they're, they're not, they're not wrong. Although Breitbart, of course, being very antagonistic to them immediately below this shows a tweet of theirs. Mentioning Hungary's pro family policy is working, births up 9. 4% pointing to a recent uptick in fertility in Hungary, which does have many perinatalist policies.So Breitbart's trying to say they're obviously wrong, but oh my gosh. Shall I continue? Yeah. The distribution of births in the future is going to be very uneven, it predicted. While the total TFR is thought to be around 1. 6 [00:25:00] and around 1. 5 across much of Europe and the United States by 2100, areas like South Korea and Eastern Europe are said to be looking at a real demographic winter with TFRs heading toward one child per woman.In other words, the natural born population of such areas would have every generation. Batajari explained. Most countries will remain below replacement levels, and once nearly every country's population is shrinking, reliance on open immigration will become necessary to sustain economic growth.Sub Saharan African countries have a vital resource that aging societies are losing. A youthful population, unquote. TheyMalcolm Collins: only have that because of extreme poverty. They are literally laying out their plans to keep these countries in poverty to use them as human farms. Oh, my God.Simone Collins: While the IHME warns of high migration in the future, where policies to encourage births in the developed world will have failed to do anything but take the edge off, the [00:26:00] body does concede such long term forecasts are difficult.Indeed, German newspaper DeWalt, totally messed that up, cited The Berlin Institute for Population and Development, which notes, quote, projections that go more than 25 years into the future are super uncertain, unquote, given the sheer number of unpredictable factors. One of these factors, as the IHME itself noticed, is, noted, is changing technology, acknowledging the impact of artificial intelligence and robotics is, quote, difficult to predict, unquote.Nevertheless, they could, quote, reduce the economic effects of changes in age structure, unquote. It's such a scientific wayMalcolm Collins: of putting it. And then, and then under it, there's another quote from Breitbart, or another tweet from Breitbart deaths of UK born overtake births of UKSimone Collins: Yeah, well, we're seeing that all over the place.Malcolm Collins: Yeah so, I mean, I think, and you can see why I wanted to read the whole article. There was nothing in that that wasn't completely insane. [00:27:00] These people are Like, yeah, it bothers me that people are always like, why are you so antagonistic to, you know, it reminds me of my, my ancestors, right? Like, you know, when they were fighting against slavery, I'm sure many of their neighbors would be like, these people are your friends.Like, why are you not friends, but like friends of your parents and stuff like that? Or like, like, you know, you guys are part of the same cultural group. Why are you fighting against them so ardently? And it's like, because of the slavery thing? The, the, the, that, that's why, the slavery thing. That's a big deal.And they're like, well, come on. I mean, it's an economic system and everyone benefits to some. No, there are some positions that some people are pursuing that are so completely indefensible. And even in, during the slavery thing, a person might be like, well, look, I don't support slavery myself, but I do have to fight for the Confederacy or I do have to vote.For, you know, democratic [00:28:00] politicians if the, the pro slavery politicians, of course, they'll pretend that, oh, I, I don't remember that the Democrats used to be. I mean, we do have to vote for the Democrats of course. And they're like, well, I mean, no, no, no, no, no. Just because you don't support that.If you vote and support a political ecosystem that leads to this as a result. You are supporting it. And if a person says, Oh, well, what's happening now is not comparable to that. Maybe what's happening in the world today, but the future that this article lays out is not that much better than slavery.Intentionally, you. keeping African countries in extreme poverty so that they can be used as human farms? And do you think that they intend on these people they ship over to displace them in leadership positions? No, they do not. They want to use them as economic force. fuel, [00:29:00] like a resource is the way they talk about them, like their oil or something, a disposable resource.And when I say disposable, I mean disposable in their mind, because when immigrants come to the United States, the average fertility rate of immigrants, and this was last I looked, so it's probably much lower now, it's 1. 7. So at the time that was measured, that was about the average fertility rate of the average American citizen.So what it falls to about the rate of the average citizen of a country. So the, these, this is not a resource that you can like ship over and it repopulates itself. You need to keep these countries in poverty, keep shipping them over. But as you do that, let's ignore the genetic effects of this. Culturally, these countries are going to become less and less productive over time.In terms of the utility of the immigrants to the tax base, which is the whole purpose of this. It's not humans. It's tax base that you're shipping over. It's economic productivity that you're shipping over. Anyway, what are your thoughts?Simone Collins: Well, I think this goes back to the very common theme with demographical apps and prenatalism of this being a litmus test [00:30:00] for anyone's world view and values.And so of course, when you look at this from this perspective, the, the Gates foundation has been very involved in Africa and very involved in, in, in, in Helping various African populations with, I think what malaria, right. And various forms of development, like they're, they're trying and they care. And I think part of this is them trying to say, look at how great Africa is.We're going to be scrambling for these amazing people that we care about a lot. And we're trying to help a lot and they just don't think through. The consequences of what they're suggesting, which in the end are very detrimental and sort of the opposite of everything they've been working toward all the development and health improvement that they're working towards.So there's a lot of irony that I see here because this is. A group that deeply, deeply cares about AfricanMalcolm Collins: populations. I disagree. I think that you haven't read some of their papers recently. So if you look at a lot of their papers, they will brag about how their interventions lower fertility rates in these countries.Simone Collins: Well, I mean, [00:31:00] to a certain extent, and again, this is something that we've even held. We don't mind the fact that as demographic transitions take place that there are fewer Disastrous teen pregnancies where people are having kids without being ready for them. We're not Arguing against that and I think that that's what they're trying to fight for They're saying look at all these people who are having kids who don't want the kids who can't take care of the kids We don't want that to happen.That's not whatMalcolm Collins: they're saying They are thrilled about a world in which african humans become a resourceSimone Collins: I mean again, I I just I just don't think you're able to model him maybe because you weren't raised in woke culture but when I read this using Previous models that I had in my head. The conclusion is like, is, is that as you can see Africa is the future.We're all going to be scrambling for these amazing people that everyone now, everyone is ignoring and resourceMalcolm Collins: of Africans. I have procured, they don't get it. You're going to be lining [00:32:00] up to buy them. We can ship them to you. Well,Simone Collins: you know, that's, It's, it's all very, as they would say, problematic, but I do think, and this is very common.I mean, listen, everybody is trying to do what's best given the information they have on hand. They have not thought through a lot of what they're doing and what they're saying. And so when you look at it through our lens, it's very, very bad. But it, I'm just trying toMalcolm Collins: say here is what is ultimately going to happen here.If they have their way, if they're able to treat human populations this way, is on a scale, because I think people are often like, yeah, there were people in the past who did things so totally indefensible that nothing that anyone is striving for today comes close to things like slavery or the holocaust in terms of The human tragedy that will be imposed by it, the world that they are setting up will [00:33:00] be on that scale of human tragedy.And, and that is why I fight so hard and why I feel so strongly about this.Simone Collins: Yeah, I mean, I, I don't fault you for that, and I, I don't think that their policies are correct, and I don't think they're looking at this from a very healthy perspective, although immigration policy is going to matter a lot in how demographic collapse plays out, so it, they're right to To highlight that is something that's important.They're right to highlight that a lot of the policies that even the Breitbart authors and editors involved in creating this story didn't seem to get, you know, Breitbart clearly thinks, well, let's just ban abortion. That's gonna solve it all. That's really gonna solve problems. Government handouts. Yeah.So they, you know, they're wrong too. Okay. I think that. It's nice to see that there are people pointing to important things that we should be debating and thinking about. So, I will try to look at this [00:34:00] optimistically and think of it as part of a productive public discourse.Malcolm Collins: I always appreciate your optimism.The ability to see the humanity. And even the most monstrous individuals while still fighting against what they stand for. And I really appreciate that. And you're like, Oh, I shouldn't be the politician of the two of us. And yet, you know, I was just at a radio show where they had interviewed her recently and they, they, they like having me on more than her because I'm more of a fire brand, but they're like, you, she is the better politician.She is the one who I would rather have representing me. And she is always the one I'd rather have was my finger on the button. And so when we heard from president. Don'tSimone Collins: worry about me because normally you have to worry about, you know, female president, you know, who's on her period. I don't get those cause I brokeMalcolm Collins: the body earlier.So, and because you're always pregnant.Simone Collins: Yeah, I'm, I'm effectively not actually female. So don't worry. Besides I'm backed by my husband and I do whatever he says. So I think that's why people [00:35:00] really want to vote for me. Well,Malcolm Collins: I think that's the type of female president everybody wants.Simone Collins: I'm really, I would love to see that.I would love to see. I'm just here to do what my husband says. Press conferences. Well, I'm going to have to ask my husband about that first. I don't know why suddenly she's Southern. I'm sorry. But no, I mean, I think that that would be great. I would definitely pull that where I, the type of person who could get elected to such positions, but I have my doubts, so we shall see come November.I love you. I love you too, Malcolm.

This is¬†The Worldview in 5 Minutes¬†heard on 140 radio stations and at¬†www.TheWorldview.com.¬† I‚Äôm Adam McManus. (Adam@TheWorldview.com) By Jonathan Clark Turkish persecution of Christians heats up The Turkish Association of Protestant Churches reports¬†Christians in Turkey¬†faced increased persecution last year. The persecution often came in the form of hateful speech either in person or online. And, iIn two cases, assailants fired guns at church buildings.¬† Turkey also banned many foreign Christians from entering the country in recent years. Nine of these Christians appealed the ban. However, a court ruled against them and published their names. Media outlets branded the Christians as enemies of the state. Many social media comments called for them to be put to death. Turkey is ranked 45th on the Open Doors‚Äô¬†World Watch List¬†of the most difficult countries worldwide to be a Christian.¬† 2.5 million acres of European Union burned The European Union is experiencing its¬†worst wildfire season¬†since records began in 2006. Nearly 2.5 million acres of land have burned so far this year. Spain and Portugal account for over two-thirds of that area. Between the two countries, over 1.5 million acres have burned with much of it happening in just two weeks. Birth rates in England and Wales continue to fall The U.K. Office for National Statistics reported last week that¬†birth rates fell¬†to a new low in England and Wales. Other developed countries are also seeing low birth rates like the United States, France, and Italy. However, there appears to be a political gap in fertility. John Burn-Murdoch of the Financial Times¬†wrote, ‚ÄúFrom the US to Europe and beyond, people who identify as conservative are having almost as many children as they were decades ago. The decline is overwhelmingly among those on the progressive left, in effect nudging each successive generation‚Äôs politics further to the right.‚Äù Quebec, Canada to ban public prayers Quebec, Canada‚Äôs largest province, is planning to¬†ban public prayer. Quebec‚Äôs Secularism Minister Jean-Fran√ßois Roberge said, ‚ÄúThe premier of Quebec has given me the mandate to strengthen secularism . . . This fall, we will therefore introduce a bill to strengthen secularism in Quebec, in particular by banning street prayers.‚Äù The move comes in response to Muslim prayer gatherings. However, it would apply to all religions including Christianity. Nearly 65% of Quebec‚Äôs population identifies as Christian. Psalm 10:4 says, ‚ÄúThe wicked,¬†in the haughtiness¬†of his countenance,¬†does not seek¬†[the Lord]. All¬†his¬†thoughts¬†are, ‚ÄòThere¬†is no¬†God.‚Äô‚Äù Univ of Michigan fired Christian doctor who objected to transgender surgeries In the United States, a federal court¬†ruled in favor¬†of a Christian in a religious liberty case. Back in 2021, the University of Michigan Health-West fired Valerie Kloosterman for her beliefs. The Christian physician assistant refused to support transgender procedures or pronoun usage. The latest ruling allows her case against the university to move forward.¬† Kayla Toney, counsel at First Liberty Institute, said, ‚ÄúToday's decision is a reckoning for institutions that discriminate and punish caring people of faith.‚Äù Bill Gates funds embalming of deceased newborns to harvest organs Modernity News reports¬†the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is funding a new gruesome project. The project involves embalming deceased newborn babies who died in neonatal intensive care units. Researchers would harvest tissues and organs from the babies for artificial intelligence development.

After World War II, the Japan Bible Society became a fully self-supporting Bible Society.¬† Its¬†website says, ‚ÄúSince then, the Japan Bible Society has not only been serving the Japanese people but also other Bible Societies that are not yet independent.‚Äù Psalm 22:27 says, ‚ÄúAll the ends of the world shall remember and turn to the LORD, and all the families of the nations shall worship before You.‚Äù Close And that's¬†The Worldview¬†on this Wednesday, September 3rd, in the year of our Lord 2025.¬†Follow us on X¬†or subscribe for free by¬†Spotify,¬†Amazon Music, or by¬†iTunes or email¬†to our unique Christian newscast at¬†www.TheWorldview.com.¬† I‚Äôm Adam McManus (Adam@TheWorldview.com).

Have an intentional strategy. Be intentional. Jonathan Livingston Seagull - The biggest limits in the world are the limits of your mind, your imagination, and your actions‚Äì not the limits of the world itself.

Bill Gates,"""Bill Gates""",2lg56AsWqz4vEJt3OL2QIp,The Two-Day Work Week: Bill Gates on AI's Promise and Perils,"Hold onto your ergonomic desk chairs ‚Äî Bill Gates says the future of your work week might only span two days, and you can thank artificial intelligence for that potential break. In a recent interview on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, Gates mused about a future where AI handles much of the heavy lifting across industries, leading to a complete transformation of how ‚Äî and how long ‚Äî we work. From tackling healthcare shortages to fighting diseases like Alzheimer‚Äôs and polio, Gates sees AI not only improving productivity but also reshaping what society values most. But he cautions: while it‚Äôs a hopeful vision, the road to AI-powered utopia might get bumpy. Key Points:  Bill Gates envisions a future in which AI reduces the standard work week to just two or three days. ‚ÄúWith AI, over the next decade, [intelligence] will become free and commonplace,‚Äù Gates said, meaning top-tier expertise could be accessible to all ‚Äî including in critical industries like healthcare and education. Gates believes AI will help solve global labor shortages, particularly in medicine and mental health, and greatly improve productivity. While tech should theoretically reduce workloads, Gates acknowledges that it has often extended work hours instead. Promoting his book ""Source Code,"" Gates highlighted AI‚Äôs role in advancing disease research and treatment ‚Äî notably Alzheimer‚Äôs, malaria, HIV, and polio. He remains hopeful that ‚Äúwith luck, within the next three to four years, polio will become the next disease that‚Äôs fully gone.‚Äù On climate change, Gates is pushing for affordable, scalable green tech and innovation, noting, ‚ÄúWe need to make really cheap green products.‚Äù However, he remains realistic: ‚ÄúPeople should be willing to pay extra for clean products, but on a global scale, they probably won‚Äôt.‚Äù Gates‚Äô broader message? Technology is driving us toward a future where both human labor and intelligence may be radically redefined.  Bonus Context:Gates has long championed the idea that AI can be a powerful equalizer ‚Äî but with thoughtful governance. Some critics note that AI's actual implementation can reinforce existing inequalities if not managed carefully. So while a two-day work week sounds dreamy, making it a reality may depend as much on policy as on software.Link to Article",https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lg56AsWqz4vEJt3OL2QIp,2025-03-28,7kaRmk3R5jizHxRhRy1zAc,jawbreaker.io,jawbreaker.io,1761323052.1017349

Bill Gates,"""Bill Gates""",3GjeRipmCWCEEXBPPwNfXy,Bill Gates And The  Constant  Downplaying Of His Relationship With Jeffrey Epstein (10/22/25),"In a recent Wall Street Journal interview, Bill Gates revisited his controversial relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, acknowledging that meeting with the convicted sex offender was ""a huge mistake."" However, Gates‚Äôs admission of ‚Äúfoolishness‚Äù rings hollow to critics, who question why such a highly intelligent and influential figure would repeatedly associate with Epstein, even after his criminal history was publicly known. Gates claimed he engaged with Epstein in hopes of advancing global health philanthropy, yet no tangible benefits emerged from these meetings, raising concerns about his judgment and motivations. Critics argue that Gates‚Äôs wealth and power afforded him ample resources to explore other philanthropic avenues without involving a figure as toxic as Epstein.Additionally, Gates‚Äôs attempts to downplay the personal fallout from his ties to Epstein invite further skepticism. Reports suggest that Epstein tried to exploit their acquaintance by threatening to expose an alleged affair involving Gates, adding a layer of complexity to the narrative. Gates‚Äôs repeated meetings with Epstein‚Äîdespite his then-wife Melinda French Gates expressing discomfort‚Äîcast doubt on his sincerity and decision-making. His efforts to frame the relationship as a lapse in judgment fail to address the broader implications of why someone in his position would disregard ethical concerns for potential personal or professional gain. This relationship has left a lingering stain on Gates‚Äôs reputation, with critics questioning whether his contrition comes from genuine regret or the need to repair his public image.to contact me:bobbycapucci@protonmail.comsource:Bill Gates Addresses His Friendship with Sex Offender Jeffrey Epstein: ‚ÄòI Was Foolish‚Äô",https://open.spotify.com/episode/3GjeRipmCWCEEXBPPwNfXy,2025-10-23,66Ufrq2B9ehCO6F9YwQoPm,Jeffrey Epstein:  The Coverup Chronicles,Bobby Capucci,1761323052.1332219

The Real Berkshire Advantage: While most focus on Buffett's acquisition strategy, Berkshire's true uniqueness is its fee structure‚ÄîBuffett aligned his incentives by getting rich alongside shareholders, not from carried interest.   Gates's Dual Persona: Bill Gates cultivated a humble public image despite being famously combative at Microsoft, demonstrating how business leaders craft public personas that may differ from their actual management styles.   The Problem with Reverse-Engineering: Attempting to copy successful models often fails because you're copying what worked in past conditions rather than the underlying strategic thinking.

Bill Gates,"""Bill Gates""",5FTzpXihoOKYGEYmjD1HV2,Bill Gates - Clean water and hand washing are the most important interventions,"Welcome to the Daily Quote ‚Äì a podcast designed to kickstart your day in a positive way. I'm your host, Andrew McGivern, for October 15th.Today is Global Handwashing Day, an international observance that might seem simple but addresses one of the most effective public health interventions in the world. Celebrated annually on October 15th since 2008, this day was established by the Global Handwashing Partnership to increase awareness about the importance of washing hands with soap.The statistics behind this simple act are remarkable. Handwashing with soap can reduce diarrheal diseases by about 30% and respiratory infections by about 20%. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we all witnessed firsthand how crucial hand hygiene is in preventing the spread of disease. Yet even today, billions of people worldwide lack adequate access to handwashing facilities, and many who have access don't wash their hands regularly or properly.What makes Global Handwashing Day important is its recognition that sometimes the most powerful solutions to complex problems are surprisingly simple. Clean hands save lives ‚Äì it's that straightforward, yet that profound.Today's quote comes from entrepreneur and philanthropist Bill Gates, who said:""Clean water and hand washing are the most important interventions.""Gates's succinct observation, drawn from years of global health work, cuts right to the heart of what Global Handwashing Day represents. In all his foundation's work addressing complex health challenges worldwide, Gates has consistently emphasized that some of the most powerful interventions are the simplest ones.Think about what this means. We often assume that solving major health problems requires cutting-edge technology, expensive treatments, or complex medical interventions. But Gates, who has invested billions in global health, keeps coming back to fundamentals: clean water and handwashing.The beauty of handwashing as an intervention is its accessibility and effectiveness. It doesn't require expensive equipment, specialized training, or high-tech infrastructure. It just requires soap, water, and knowledge ‚Äì yet it prevents millions of deaths annually, particularly among children under five.Gates understands what public health experts have proven: handwashing is one of the highest-return investments we can make in human health. The simplicity of the solution doesn't diminish its power ‚Äì it enhances it, because simple solutions can be implemented widely and sustained over time.Global Handwashing Day reminds us that sometimes the most important interventions aren't the most complicated ones.As you head into your Wednesday, honor Global Handwashing Day and Bill Gates's insight by being more intentional about hand hygiene. Not just washing your hands, but washing them properly ‚Äì for at least 20 seconds, with soap, covering all surfaces including between fingers and under nails.Think about the key times to wash: before eating or preparing food, after using the bathroom, after coughing or sneezing, after touching surfaces in public places. These simple acts protect not just you, but everyone you come in contact with.Gates has devoted enormous resources to global health, yet keeps emphasizing this fundamental intervention. That tells us something important ‚Äì don't overlook simple solutions in favor of complicated ones. Sometimes the most powerful action is the most basic one.That's going to do it for today. I'm Andrew McGivern signing off for now. But I'll be back tomorrow, same pod time, same pod station - with another Daily Quote.",https://open.spotify.com/episode/5FTzpXihoOKYGEYmjD1HV2,2025-10-15,6xVbOxcL3a8S11CaSTRt0I,the Daily Quote,Andrew McGivern ,1761323053.1283731

Bill Gates,"""Bill Gates""",6kJnFkxEhQyCbNHaH1Q9R6,"Kenyan pro-lifers object to Bill Gates‚Äô abortion kill pills, 5% of Canadian deaths due to euthanasia, Most evil nations vs. best behaved nations","It‚Äôs Tuesday, August 26th, A.D. 2025. This is¬†The Worldview in 5 Minutes¬†heard on 140 radio stations and at¬†www.TheWorldview.com.¬† I‚Äôm Adam McManus. (Adam@TheWorldview.com) By Kevin Swanson Women in India raped, murdered, and secretly buried A temple maintenance man in India is under arrest, after he testified of hundreds of women who were allegedly raped, murdered, and secretly buried around the small religious town of Dharmasthala. The¬†BBC reports¬†that nearly 100 bone fragments of human remains have already been found at two spots the man identified. The employee says he worked for the temple administration between 1995 and 2014, when he was allegedly coerced into burying the bodies. In 2025, 950 attacks on Christians in India For the first five months of 2025,¬†Open Doors reports¬†950 attacks on Christians in India, which accounts for a rate of 2,300 per year. According to this reliable source, ‚ÄúThese incidents included attacks, threats to abandon the Christian faith, excommunication, social boycotts, halting prayer services and church closures. Throughout India, 200 cases have been filed against pastors and believers based on fabricated conversion allegations.‚Äù  India rated as the worst in The Worldview‚Äôs international morality index ¬†-- or the Evil Index -- released last month. India rated high in persecuting Christians, corruption perceptions, as well as supporting abortion and homosexuality. Most evil nations vs. Best behaved nations The highest rated nations for immorality were India, North Korea, Mexico, Columbia, Vietnam, Pakistan, Nepal, Myanmar, Somalia, Nicaragua, China, and Nigeria. Best nations on the list were Armenia, Eastern European nations, Israel, Japan, and Singapore. Among European nations, Russia, Greenland, and Belgium¬†were rated poorly. Switzerland and Ireland rated best on this International Morality Index.¬† The nation of Chile lost the most ground over the last eight years. The country was rated at the top of the morality index eight years ago, and has dropped to the 66th position, due largely to approving abortion in 2017, and adopting homosexual faux-marriage in 2022.¬†¬† The International Morality Index considers nations on the basis of the sixth, seventh, and eighth commandments of God‚Äôs law as well as the persecution of Christians.¬† John 1:29 says, ‚ÄúBut let us remember, this is why Jesus came. . . John saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, ‚ÄòBehold!¬†The Lamb of God¬†who takes away the sin of the world!‚Äô‚Äù Kenyan pro-lifers object to Bill Gates‚Äô abortion kill pills Kenyan pro-lifers have issued a petition addressed to Kenya‚Äôs Ministry of Health, complaining of IPAS Africa Alliance‚Äôs distribution of abortion kill pills throughout the country.¬†¬† The petition accuses IPAS of breaking Kenya‚Äôs laws, and flooding schools and pharmacies with the kill pill.¬†¬† The Citizen Go petition notes that ‚ÄúKenya‚Äôs laws protect unborn life, but IPAS is exploiting loopholes. They hand out abortion pills without scans, prescriptions, or medical supervision.‚Äù IPAS Africa Alliance is reportedly funded¬†by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Mexican drug cartel leader pled guilty ‚ÄúBe sure your sins will find you out.‚Äù That‚Äôs what Number 32:23 warns.  The founder of the largest drug cartel in the world, Mexican cartel kingpin Isamel ‚ÄúEl Mayo‚Äù Zambada, pled guilty to federal charges yesterday, reports the Associated Press. He is charged with organizing a drug smuggling operation into the US, called the Sinaloa cartel.¬†¬† His partner Joaquin ‚ÄúEl Chapo‚Äù Guzman was found guilty of similar charges in 2019. The Mexican Sinoloa cartel is known for assassinations, tortures, and kidnappings ‚Äî terrorizing parts of the southern border areas of Mexico and Texas. Today, first time home purchase costs double rent For the first time in almost 20 years, the price of¬†buying an entry-level home¬†is double the expense of renting. Austin, Denver, Las Vegas, and Phoenix are some of the worst places for unaffordable properties for first-time buyers. 5% of Canadian deaths due to euthanasia  Canada‚Äôs Doctor Assisted Deaths now account for 5% of total deaths for the nation ‚Äî more than the deaths attributed to diabetes and Alzheimer‚Äôs combined. ¬† Persons suffering solely from some sort of mental illness will be able to gain state medical help to kill themselves on March 17, 2027. In related news, the United Kingdom Bill on euthanasia¬†has passed the House of Commons, and now has been presented to the House of Lords. United Kingdom legislature to dismiss jail time for violent offenders And finally, the United Kingdom government has come up with a plan to reduce prison overcrowding by dismissing jail time altogether for thousands of sex offenders, drug dealers, and violent criminals. The Sentencing Bill will be considered next month by parliament, reports The Times.¬† Exodus 22:1¬†¬†provides God‚Äôs wisdom in such matters. ‚ÄúIf a man steals an ox or a sheep, and slaughters it or sells it, he shall¬†restore five oxen for an ox and four sheep for a sheep.‚Äù Close And that's¬†The Worldview¬†on this Tuesday, August 26th, in the year of our Lord 2025.¬†Follow us on X¬†or subscribe for free by¬†Spotify,¬†Amazon Music, or by¬†iTunes or email¬†to our unique Christian newscast at¬†www.TheWorldview.com.¬† I‚Äôm Adam McManus (Adam@TheWorldview.com).

Bill Gates,"""Bill Gates""",6oh7y2YeI3YYIgMnUdmXP9,Bill Gates And The  Constant  Downplaying Of His Relationship With Jeffrey Epstein,"In a recent Wall Street Journal interview, Bill Gates revisited his controversial relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, acknowledging that meeting with the convicted sex offender was ""a huge mistake."" However, Gates‚Äôs admission of ‚Äúfoolishness‚Äù rings hollow to critics, who question why such a highly intelligent and influential figure would repeatedly associate with Epstein, even after his criminal history was publicly known. Gates claimed he engaged with Epstein in hopes of advancing global health philanthropy, yet no tangible benefits emerged from these meetings, raising concerns about his judgment and motivations. Critics argue that Gates‚Äôs wealth and power afforded him ample resources to explore other philanthropic avenues without involving a figure as toxic as Epstein.Additionally, Gates‚Äôs attempts to downplay the personal fallout from his ties to Epstein invite further skepticism. Reports suggest that Epstein tried to exploit their acquaintance by threatening to expose an alleged affair involving Gates, adding a layer of complexity to the narrative. Gates‚Äôs repeated meetings with Epstein‚Äîdespite his then-wife Melinda French Gates expressing discomfort‚Äîcast doubt on his sincerity and decision-making. His efforts to frame the relationship as a lapse in judgment fail to address the broader implications of why someone in his position would disregard ethical concerns for potential personal or professional gain. This relationship has left a lingering stain on Gates‚Äôs reputation, with critics questioning whether his contrition comes from genuine regret or the need to repair his public image.to contact me:bobbycapucci@protonmail.comsource:Bill Gates Addresses His Friendship with Sex Offender Jeffrey Epstein: ‚ÄòI Was Foolish‚ÄôBecome a supporter of this podcast: https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/the-epstein-chronicles--5003294/support.",https://open.spotify.com/episode/6oh7y2YeI3YYIgMnUdmXP9,2025-10-24,6gQDvlvEa89IH90jHfuIRM,The Epstein Chronicles,Bobby Capucci,1761323054.2561047

Bill Gates,"""Bill Gates""",6lZbn0StzCkgR9Vm5KYxWq,"Mega Edition:  Bill Gates, The Endless Apologies And The CNN Interview (9/25/25)","Bill Gates‚Äôs attempts at damage control over his ties to Jeffrey Epstein have always sounded less like sincere apologies and more like carefully worded PR spin. He repeatedly leaned on the same tired line that he ‚Äúmade a mistake‚Äù by meeting Epstein, as if multiple visits, a cozy dinner at Epstein‚Äôs Manhattan townhouse, and repeated interactions could somehow be reduced to a one-off lapse in judgment. His apologies are weasel-like because they dodge the central issue: Gates didn‚Äôt just bump into Epstein‚Äîhe engaged with him knowingly, long after Epstein was a convicted sex offender. Instead of admitting that he chose power networking over morality, he frames it as a regrettable oversight, a minor slip in judgment, as though the public should simply nod along and accept that excuse.Even worse, Gates couches his apologies in a tone of self-pity, acting as though he‚Äôs the real victim because people keep asking him about it. Rather than grappling with the disgust of survivors who know exactly what Epstein was, Gates seems more concerned about how the association tarnishes his image and legacy. He wants the world to believe that his proximity to a predator was an innocent blunder, when in reality it was deliberate and calculated‚ÄîEpstein had money, connections, and a reputation Gates clearly found useful. The result is an apology that reeks of arrogance and evasion, a weasel-like maneuver to deflect blame while never fully owning the gravity of choosing to keep company with a man everyone knew was radioactive.to¬† contact me:bobbycapucci@protonmail.com",https://open.spotify.com/episode/6lZbn0StzCkgR9Vm5KYxWq,2025-09-26,4iEqZ6ID2Wgl3foobQMlNN,Beyond The Horizon,Bobby Capucci,1761323054.279206

""Be a light to the world."" Every few years, it seems, a new celebrity benefit appears. Chock full of A-listers and inspirational tag lines, it promises to tackle any number of the world‚Äôs large-scale problems, whether poverty, climate change, or disease prevention and eradication. From Live Aid in the 1980s to Bono‚Äôs ONE Campaign of the early 2000s to the latest Global Citizen concerts, televised celebrity charity events, and their many associated NGOs, have enjoyed glowing media attention and a reputation as generally benign, even beloved, pieces of pop culture history. But behind the claims to end the world‚Äôs ills lies a cynical network of funding and influence from predatory financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, multinationals like Coca-Cola and Cargill, soft-power organs like USAID, and private ‚Äúphilanthropic‚Äù arms like the Gates Foundation. This arrangement reached its high point at the turn of the 21st century and continues today, largely in response to outrage from anti-Pharma and anti-poverty activists from the global south and anti-globalization protesters in the 1990s. This Bono-Bill Gates-World Bank model has gained virtually unchallenged media coverage as the new face of slick, NGO ""activism,"" in opposition to the unwieldy, anarchist-y and genuinely grassroots nature of the opposition it faced on America‚Äôs television screens each time there was a G7 or WTO meeting. While this celebrity-NGO complex purports to reduce suffering in the Global South - almost always a monolithic and mysterious place called ""Africa,"" to be more specific - suffering on a grand scale never meaningfully decreases. Rather, it adheres to a vague ‚ÄúWe Must Do Something‚Äù form of liberal politics, identifying no perpetrators of or reasons for the world‚Äôs ills other than an abstract sense of corruption or ""inaction."" Meanwhile, powerful Western interests, intellectual property regimes and corporate money - the primary drivers of global poverty - are not only ignored, but held up as the solution to the very problems they perpetuate. On this episode, we study the advent of the celebrity benefit and the attendant Bono-Bill Gates-Global Citizen model of ""activism,"" examining the dangers inherent in this approach and asking why the media aren't more skeptical of these high-profile PR events that loudly announce, with bleeding hearts the existence of billions of victims but are, mysteriously, unable to name a single victimizer.

""Inside Bill Gates's Hive Mind : Decoding Ukraine""","In this episode, we are going to get inside the hive mind of Bill Gates. He will serve the role of being the face for so many of the faceless mechanisms that are pushing agriculture and our planet to the brink of¬†destruction. Personally I can't stand him or the commercial media¬†insistence on continuously asking for his opinions on matters which he ¬†has no authority on whatsoever. The man is not a doctor nor a farmer yet¬†today he has been allowed to buy political control of both of these institutions that are as old as mankind itself. This madness is being brought to the forefront right now in Ukraine. ¬†  So far the ¬†pattern of the bio-peace and warfare series have been to start far back¬†in time and then up to the present. First from unit 731 through Rwanda,¬†India and the HIV crisis of the 80s ending up in the contemporary mess of the modern Zaibatsu and Nazi conglomerates that are killing all insects. Now again we will have moved from the Victorian holocaust and The high Qing up through the GLF and in to present Ukraine.  Thus today I will tell the much neglected story of the parapolitical economy of that country's farming and the structure of the modern latifundia. Known¬†as the bread basket of Europe, this research regarding the relationship between deep state intrigues and Big Ag has at least made things a lot¬†clearer for me and I hope that what I found out will do the same for¬†you.

His competitive spirit was evident, as he spoke about always staying ahead of the curve and anticipating potential threats. Gates wasn't afraid to make bold moves, like dropping out of Harvard to pursue his software dreams or challenging industry giants like IBM.Beyond business, we explored his personal life - his close relationships with figures like Steve Jobs, Warren Buffet and Bono - and saw how these partnerships have enriched his journey. We also got a glimpse into his family life, his marriage to Melinda, and his approach to raising their children.A recurring theme was his emphasis on using technology as a tool for good. From revolutionizing personal computing to tackling global health challenges like malaria and polio through his foundation, Gates believes in the power of innovation to solve complex problems. His current focus on climate change and sustainable energy solutions reflects his commitment to leaving a positive legacy.Ultimately, we saw a man who, despite immense wealth and success, remains grounded and driven by a desire to make a meaningful impact on the world.

Bill Gates,"""Bill Gates""",6R8quFHVPVNXUCgGDhkw8W,Episode 51 - Bill Gates: The Boy Genius of Microsoft,"Before he was a philanthropist or a global health icon, Bill Gates was a fiercely competitive computer geek who dropped out of Harvard to start a software company. This episode returns to the very beginning of the personal computer revolution to tell the origin story of Microsoft. We explore the pivotal partnership between the brilliant programmer Bill Gates and his childhood friend, the visionary Paul Allen, who together saw that the future of computing lay not in the hardware, but in the software that would run on it. The centerpiece of the story is the legendary, high-stakes deal that put Microsoft on the map: their agreement to provide the operating system for IBM's new personal computer. We reveal the true story behind MS-DOS, the software they didn't actually own when they promised it to IBM, forcing them to quickly buy it from another Seattle programmer. This audacious bluff was the foundational moment for Microsoft's empire, securing them a piece of every PC that would be sold for decades to come. It was a masterstroke of business savvy and youthful nerve. This is the story of the birth of a titan, focusing on the raw ambition and technical brilliance of a young Bill Gates.

This episode examines the profound and deliberate transformation of Bill Gates's public image, one of the most successful acts of reputation management in history. We explore his transition away from Microsoft to focus full-time on the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, an organization with an endowment so vast it operates like a small, efficient nation-state. We analyze the immense good the foundation has accomplished, from its role in nearly eradicating polio to its massive investments in fighting malaria and HIV/AIDS, saving millions of lives. However, we also investigate the criticisms leveled against the foundation. We expose how its investment portfolio has included holdings in companies that contribute to the very problems it claims to be solving, and we question the ethics and accountability of a private, unelected billionaire wielding such immense influence over global health and agriculture policy. Is this philanthropy, or a new form of ideological power? This is a story of legacy. We contrast the two distinct chapters of Bill Gates's life, forcing us to ask whether the immense good he has done in his second act can, or should, erase the memory of the cutthroat tactics he used in his first. It is the ultimate case study in the power of a billionaire to reshape not only the world, but his own story.",https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nWNX0uFTKamicvhpjwpaH,2025-10-13,3btP252jR42vlJJR53w2jD,Billionaire Biographies,Maitt Saiwyer,1761323056.3451672

Before this date, the foundation will double its philanthropy, spending $200 billion over the next two decades. The announcement comes as the organization, which has given away $100 billion since 2000, marks its 25th anniversary.  Meanwhile, at the end of last week, U.S. President Donald Trump‚Äôs budget proposed an unprecedented slashing of U.S. foreign assistance, making huge cuts to global health, humanitarian aid, and core economic and development work. We discuss the details of Trump‚Äôs budget proposal for fiscal year 2026, and its potential impact on the global development sector.   As the future of foreign aid remains in limbo, 400,000 boxes of food for malnourished children remain stuck in the United States.

Themba Gorimbo UFC Fighter As we wrap up 2024, we have a conversation with a young athlete who has defied the odds in every aspect of life, endured unimaginable challenges and is now sharing his extraordinary journey with Ryan, Channing and Fred on this episode of The Pivot Podcast. Themba Gorimbo, is coming off a devastating loss in UFC 310 to Vincente Luque and shares how the past couple weeks he hasn't wanted to wake up and details the moments he remembers after his 52 second defeat in Las Vegas at T Mobile Arena, how his country turned on him and how the negative words and reception from fans across the world has crippled him mentally and emotionally. But despite the pain he feels, Themba is reminded of how lucky he is to be alive today after a life of danger, trauma and instability. Born and raised in Zimbabwe, Themba's path to the UFC was anything but conventional. Hearing his story, the guys react as if it's a movie playing out as Themba details his childhood of dealing blood diamonds, being held hostage, running for his life, his family dying in front of him and escaping the unthinkable to make it to the land of opportunity. And then like any Hollywood film, a hero comes along to save him except this isn't Hollywood, this is Themba's true reality. Themba tells Ryan, Channing and Fred how his will to survive led him to the octagon, seeking a career in Mixed Martial Arts as he shares how on the morning of his first real fight, he only had $7.49 to his name and posted about it to show how he was down and could come back up. His message caught more attention than he could hope for, when Dwayne The Rock Johnson saw it and stepped in to help change Themba's life forever... The Rock may be Themba's real life saver but the true hero is Themba himself as his story is a powerful testament to resilience, determination, and the relentless pursuit of a dream. Coming off a heartbreaking loss brought on tears of embarrassment and hurt pride, but he is showing signs of strength again by opening up and trying to rise again. From humble beginnings to the pinnacle of professional fighting, his unwavering work ethic, sacrifices made along the way and the pivotal moments that shaped the man he is today, this conversation goes beyond the cage and into the heart of what it means to pivot when life throws the hardest punches.

"Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson","""Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson""",5V9VEDSsPfqLRkxhEIQsTv,"Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson - Audio Biography","Dwayne Douglas Johnson, famously known as ""The Rock,"" is an American actor, producer, businessman, and former professional wrestler. Born on May 2, 1972, in Hayward, California, Johnson has become one of the most recognizable and influential figures in the entertainment industry. Early Life and Family: Dwayne Johnson was born into a family with a rich wrestling heritage. His grandfather, Peter Maivia, and his father, Rocky Johnson, were both professional wrestlers. Growing up, Johnson lived in various places, including New Zealand, Hawaii, and Pennsylvania. He attended multiple high schools due to his family's frequent relocations and eventually settled in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, where he began to excel in sports, particularly football. College and Football Career: Johnson received a full scholarship to play football at the University of Miami. He was a promising defensive tackle and was part of the University of Miami's national championship team in 1991. However, injuries plagued his college football career, and after graduating with a Bachelor of General Studies in criminology and physiology in 1995, he decided to pursue a career in professional wrestling. Professional Wrestling Career: Dwayne Johnson made his WWE (then known as WWF) debut in 1996 as Rocky Maivia, a combination of his father's and grandfather's ring names. He initially portrayed a heroic character, but the audience reaction was lukewarm. In 1997, Johnson turned heel and rebranded himself as ""The Rock,"" a charismatic and trash-talking villain. This transformation marked a turning point in his career, and he quickly became one of the most popular wrestlers in the industry. Throughout his wrestling career, The Rock engaged in numerous high-profile feuds with the likes of Stone Cold Steve Austin, Triple H, and John Cena. He won the WWE Championship eight times and the WWF/E Intercontinental Championship twice. Johnson's catchphrases, such as ""If you smell what The Rock is cooking!"" and ""Do you smell it?"", along with his signature moves like ""The People's Elbow"" and ""The Rock Bottom,"" became iconic among fans. Acting Career: While still active in wrestling, Dwayne Johnson began to explore opportunities in acting. His first leading role was in the 2002 movie ""The Scorpion King,"" which set a record for the highest-grossing opening weekend for a film headlined by a first-time lead actor. He continued to appear in films such as ""The Rundown"" (2003), ""Walking Tall"" (2004), and ""Be Cool"" (2005) while balancing his wrestling commitments. In 2011, Johnson's acting career reached new heights with his role as Luke Hobbs in the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise, beginning with ""Fast Five."" The character's popularity led to a spin-off movie, ""Hobbs & Shaw"" (2019), co-starring Jason Statham. Johnson's other notable film credits include ""G.I. Joe: Retaliation"" (2013), ""Pain & Gain"" (2013), ""Hercules"" (2014), ""San Andreas"" (2015), ""Central Intelligence"" (2016), ""Moana"" (2016) (voice role), ""Baywatch"" (2017), ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" (2017), and its sequel, ""Jumanji: The Next Level"" (2019). Business Ventures and Philanthropy: Dwayne Johnson has also found success as a businessman. He co-founded the entertainment production company Seven Bucks Productions, which has produced several of his films and television shows, including the HBO series ""Ballers"" (2015-2019), in which he also starred. In 2020, Johnson and his ex-wife Dany Garcia, along with investment company RedBird Capital Partners, acquired the XFL football league. Johnson is known for his philanthropic efforts and dedication to various charitable causes. He founded the Dwayne Johnson Rock Foundation, which works with at-risk and terminally ill children. He has also been involved with the Make-A-Wish Foundation and has granted numerous wishes for children battling life-threatening illnesses. Personal Life: Dwayne Johnson married Dany Garcia in 1997, and they have a daughter together named Simone. The couple divorced amicably in 2007. Johnson then began a relationship with Lauren Hashian, with whom he has two daughters: Jasmine (born 2015) and Tiana (born 2018). Johnson and Hashian married in 2019. In conclusion, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson's journey from a young boy in a wrestling family to a global superstar is a testament to his hard work, dedication, and versatility. His success in wrestling, acting, and business, along with his charismatic personality and philanthropic efforts, have made him one of the most beloved and influential figures in popular culture. As he continues to take on new challenges and roles, it is clear that The Rock's impact on the entertainment industry will endure for years to come. Thanks for listening to Quiet Please.

"Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson","""Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson""",4N8PLS4Yf5QjokhCD6Jn63,"#16 Wrestling und Storytelling ‚Äì Was man von Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson und der WWE lernen kann","Wrestling ist ein spektakul√§res Schauspiel und die WWE ein Riesengesch√§ft, aufgebaut auf der Kunst, Geschichten zu erz√§hlen. F√ºr Wrestler und Funktion√§r Triple H war Storytelling immer wichtiger, als den spektakul√§rsten Move des Kampfes vorzuf√ºhren. Auch im Marketing und Personal Branding ist Storytelling das wichtigste Tool f√ºr jeden von uns. Grund genug sich anzusehen, wie die WWE eine unendliche Geschichte erz√§hlt.  Hulk Hogan wurde zum ersten Megastar des Sports. Mehr noch: er wurde Vorbild einer Nation. Weil er so gut k√§mpfen konnte? Nein, seine Geschichte zeigt: Leistung allein reicht nicht aus, um Massen zu elektrisieren. Mach stattdessen dich, dein Produkt und deine Marke zur Projektionsfl√§che f√ºr Sehns√ºchte!  Wichtig ist, sich dar√ºber im Klaren zu sein, welche Rolle man selbst in seiner Geschichte spielen kann. So wie Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, der es wie kein zweiter schafft, Hingabe und Lockerheit zu verbinden. Warum? Weil er sich selbst spielt. Ein Character, der nicht um die Eigenschaften der eigenen Person herum gebaut ist, hat keine Chance.  Der Macher der WWE, Vince McMahon, ging beim Aufbau seines Imperiums nicht zimperlich vor. Und spielt in den Shows entsprechend den B√∂sewicht. Muss man manchmal der B√∂se sein, um weit kommen? Die dunkle Triade ist tats√§chlich keine Wrestling Crew, sondern ein wichtiger Begriff in der Personalpsychologie. Bereichern oder schaden uns Menschen im Team, die narzisstisch, machiavellistisch oder sogar psychopathisch sind? Was sagt Harvard dazu? Spannende Geschichte!  Lrnings:  - Die beste Marketing-Aktion hat nicht so viel Power, wie ein konsistentes Storytelling. Du erz√§hlst eine unendliche Geschichte. Du kannst die Realit√§t nicht kontrollieren, aber du deutest sie und machst sie zum Teil deiner Geschichte. - Leistung allein reicht nicht aus, um Massen zu elektrisieren. Mach dich, dein Produkt und deine Marke zur Projektionsfl√§che f√ºr Sehns√ºchte. - Definiere, welche Rolle du als Mensch in der Welt einnehmen m√∂chtest - und zahle mit jeder Handlung auf dieses Versprechen ein.  - Wenn dir etwas vorgeworfen wird, √ºberleg, ob du es  dir zu Eigen machen willst.  - Narzissmus, Machiavellismus und Psychopathie k√∂nnen Karrieren erm√∂glichen. Aber sie schaden Teams und Unternehmen.

"Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson","""Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson""",5pmdDoVZgeWn3MyyWmqL7A,"ZOA Energy Drink Brand a Failure? | How Can Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson & Molson Coors Fix It?","Over its first 3.5 years in market, the only constant at ZOA Energy seems to be change. So, I'll start this content off by reconciling some of my original thoughts around ZOA Energy (from a content piece I created a month before the energy drink even launched), with the drastic changes ZOA made in January 2023. This includes product enhancements, flavor adjustments, and shifts to the visual identity (and brand strategy). Yet, that original brand strategy and associated packaging design felt very much like Dwayne ‚ÄúThe Rock‚Äù Johnson was extremely involved in ensuring it properly articulated and aestheticized his defining personality traits. But then the question likely shifts to why did ZOA Energy make all these changes anyways? The simple answer is expectations! Firstly, you have arguably one of the biggest global celebrities behind the company, that seemed authentically motivated, and within a product category that seemed aligned with him. Next, you had a U.S. energy drinks market that was on fire‚Ä¶especially within the categorical fragmentation of ‚Äúenergy plus.‚Äù Finally, you had a ‚ÄúDay 1‚Äù strategic partnership (and investment) by Molson Coors that provided national sales, field marketing, and distribution resources. This is a recipe for not just success‚Ä¶but outsized success! So, despite the relatively strong start...the brand was underperforming key competitors (e.g. Alani Nu and GHOST energy drinks) that launched within an 8-month period of ZOA Energy. While Molson Coors CEO Gavin Hattersley admitted ZOA Energy made several strategic missteps out the gate...he also stressed that it broke the golden rule of brand building by scaling too quickly. Yet, both Alani Nu and GHOST have been beverage industry rocket ships and now both passed the $600 million mark in retail sales over the most recent 52-week period (outselling ZOA Energy by 20 times more). But even with relatively weak performance since that January 2023 brand reset, Molson Coors expanded its strategic partnership with (and investment in) ZOA Energy. Why? After losing La Colombe Coffee Roasters to a strategic partnership with KDP, ZOA Energy became really the only sizable non-alcoholic (and health and wellness positioned) brand within the Molson Coors beyond beer portfolio...which I'll explain why I believe that's problematic. Finally, I'll examine several different implications around the timing of the brand reset that created distance between ZOA Energy and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. In today‚Äôs ultra-competitive U.S. energy drinks market, brand authenticity matters A LOT‚Ä¶and that‚Äôs because energy drinks are marketed as a lifestyle beverage that offers the functional benefit of energy. But wouldn‚Äôt that help an energy drink with Dwayne ‚ÄòThe Rock‚Äô Johnson weaved into the brand DNA? Yes, but only if ZOA Energy still felt like an authentic ‚Äúenergy drink‚Äù extension of him‚Ä¶and more importantly, the public still felt like they even knew who the authentic Dwayne ‚ÄòThe Rock‚Äô Johnson was anymore. While changing the look, feel, and tone of ZOA Energy in the first few years was maybe a good decision in a vacuum, it (along with) the ‚ÄúBig Dwayne Energy‚Äù marketing campaign exacerbated this feeling with consumers that the brand felt more like just another diverse set of movie roles for the actor Dwyane ‚ÄúThe Rock‚Äù Johnson. So, for this energy drink brand to really have a chance at meaningful success, ZOA can't just be another ‚Äòad‚Äô for its superstar co-founder or it‚Äôs destined to continuing going ZOAwhere.
